17 May 2015,tt0111161,ur35083762,False,"My first inspirational movie of my entire life... In 1947 Portland, Maine, banker Andy Dufresne is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover and sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the fictional Shawshank State Penitentiary in rural Maine. Andy befriends prison contraband smuggler, Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an inmate serving a life sentence. Red procures a rock hammer and later a large poster of Rita Hayworth for Andy. Working in the prison laundry, Andy is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader, Bogs. In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal captain of the guards, Byron Hadley, complaining about being taxed on an inheritance and offers to help him legally shelter the money. After a vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley beats Bogs severely. Bogs is sent to another prison and Andy is never attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton meets Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen. Andy's new job is a pretext for him to begin managing financial matters for the prison employees. As time passes, the Warden begins using Andy to handle matters for a variety of people including guards from other prisons and the warden himself. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decaying library.",9,Perfect

First review on IMDb.",10,Just praises for a fine film!
30 December 2013,tt0111161,ur36783485,True,"This movie is based on a novel by Stephen King, but don't let that put you off. It's not a horror film, rather a thumpingly good ode to friendship, hope, wit, wiles and wisdom, brimming with crackling characters and topped with the most twisteroo of twists since The Crying Game. Found guilty of killing his unfaithful wife and her lover in a fit of passion, sullen accountant Andy Dufresne (Robbins, casting off his goof ball image to display more layers than the proverbial onion) is shipped to the Gothic wind-swept corridors of the Shawshank State Prison for life. It is here the movie gracefully unfolds. With a beautifully rounded script, writer/director Darabont conjures up a spellbinding personal odyssey stretching through the years from 1946 to 1967. Dufresne, all the while protesting his innocence, slowly overcomes the hellfire tortures of the prison system - an unblinking range of beatings, rapings and abject humiliations - while managing to inspire his fellow inmates to lift their degraded horizons. Among them is Red (Freeman, in a matchless supporting role), the lifer who can, given time, provide virtually anything. And for reasons best known to himself, Dufresne requires 40s starlet Rita Hayworth, provisioned in poster form. The mood swings rigorously through every emotion as the cranky, wiseguy and downright crazed array of criminals bare the brunt of the turbulent life within the doomy Shawshank catacomb. Then it gets really mean, gearing up for its injury-time shockers. Dufresne, a whiz with figures, is bullied into running the warden's (Gunton) petty accounting scams, giving him the chance to execute his and the film's final, greatest miracle. If you're miserable enough to look for gripes then, yes, it does drift on too long and who needs prison buggery again? Yet the ending has such poetic completeness you're too busy contentedly chuckling to worry about sore behinds. This may have confounded American audiences - it flopped big-time on planet Yank - but a more divine movie experience you will not find this side of Oscardom. Spread the word.",10,One of The Greatest Films Ever Made

Overall this inspirational motion picture is definitely out of this world. In my opinion this Movie is thought-provoking and it touches your sole in many ways.Andy Dufresne who was unlawfully sentenced to life in prison for the murder of his wife and her lover, became great friends with 'Red' a convict who was an influential inmate inside the Shawshank prison, they became a surprising partnership inside Shawshank prison Night after night, day after day, Andy tried to adapt to prison life, however he realised he shouldn't be in this indescribable road to hell so thats where his plans begin....",10,"Thought-provoking, greatest film of all time...."
13 October 2014,tt0111161,ur55673139,True,"This movie is not your ordinary Hollywood flick. It has a great and deep message. This movie has a foundation and just kept on being built on from their and that foundation is hope.Other than just the message of this movie the acting was phenomenal. Tim Robbins gave one of the greatest performances ever. He was inspiring, intelligent and most of all positive. His performance just made me smile. Robbins plays Andy Dufresne who was wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. He is gets to life sentences but yet never gives up hope. In he becomes friends with Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding played by Morgan Freeman. Freeman who gives the finest performance of his career has unlike Robbins lost hope. He is in deep regret of the crime that he committed. His way of deflecting the pain away is by trying to not feel anything at all. With his friendship with Andy he learns that without our hopes and dreams we have nothing. Andy also becomes friends with the rest of Red's group. James Whitmore also gave a great performance as Brooks Halten who gets out of prison parole but in the words of Red he has been ""institutionalized"". The directing by Frank Darabont was just magnificent. He kept this movie at a great steady pace along with the writing and great cinematography. He portrayed prison life in such a horrifying way, but not in terms of the physical pain but the stress and pain that wares mentally on the inmates, some of which deserve a second chance.",9,When i was trapped!
29 July 1999,tt0111161,ur0401412,False,"By far Shawshank was the best film of 1994. But look who it was up against at the Oscars...Forrest Gump. It's not that Forrest Gump was such a horrible movie as alot of people make it out to be, in fact it was good. But it was also a very hyped movie. The public ate it up, and they also got too much of it. That might be the reason everybody on the internet seems to hate it so. But to say Forrest Gump is better than the Shawshank Redemtion is a far cry. I wish the Oscar's didn't do this all the time. They vote on who they think the public wants to win it seems like sometimes. It was robbed. But that doesn't make it any less of a film. It's a triumph of filmmaking. Robbins and Freeman are excellent. The character Brooks is terrific, and the warden is protrayed perfectly by Bob Gunton. Go rent this movie, if it's the last thing you do.

25 January 2010,tt0111161,ur22760960,False,"Acted out perfectly by every cast member, under the watchful eye of Frank Darabont, the story of a man who brings hope to the grey walls of Shawshank prison becomes so much more than a prison movie. The first time I ever saw ""The Shawshank Redemption"", I knew nothing about it, and was utterly unprepared for it's effect. Within the first ten minutes, I was utterly drawn in, unable to pull my eyes away from the screen. By the end of the first hour, I couldn't even think about pausing or stopping this film. I spent the last fifteen minutes crying my eyes out at the sheer emotion in those minutes. Morgan Freeman out-does his every role previous and every role since as Red, while Tim Robbins, quiet and intense, leads the cast as Andy. This film been regarded for more than fifteen years as one of the greatest to ever emerge from cinema. It is a story of corruption, and of justice. A story of imprisonment and of freedom. A story of despair and of hope.

The impact of this film surpasses the average moving going experience so far to the point that it has effected people's lives personally, along with my own.

There's not a single moment in the film that I can point to and claim that it ought to be different.﻿ There are times when ""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes dangerously close to sounding one of those ""triumph of the human spirit"" notes. But most of it is eloquently restrained. Despite an excess of voice-over narration and inspirational music, Mr. Darabont's film has a genuine dignity that holds the interest. It is helped greatly by fine, circumspect performances from Morgan Freeman as a rueful lifer named Red and Tim Robbins as Andy, the new kid on the cellblock.

3 November 2017,tt0111161,ur81881661,True,"This movie was an incredible disappointment. I came into watching this movie looking for some deep introspective storytelling, and all I got was a pile of steaming feces. Now one major disappointment (spoilers ahead), was that the characters didn't make ANY fart jokes. Not even once! Now you may call this childish, but I believe that fart jokes are the pinnacle of introspective, existential comedy that really elevates the themes of a plot to another level. Instead, all the jokes fell flat and didn't really make me think about the deep universal consequences of flatulence. Another major complaint was the cast. Yes, I know this is something I cannot change, but I believe the cast would have much better if instead of Morgan Freeman, they cast incredible method actor Dylan Sprouse as Red. I believe Mr. Sprouse would have taken the character of Red to the next level instead of the flat, one dimensional character that Mr. Freeman ""acted"" as (if you would call that acting). The one high point in this movie was the large amount of diversity. I was really happy seeing an Asian, lesbian character as the main character. That kind of diversity is what Hollywood needs. My only wish is that she would be played by a more versatile actor, like Jared Leto or Ashely Tisdale. Overall, this was a disappointment of a movie, and really did not merit the awards it got.",1,Absolutely awful!

14 March 1999,tt0111161,ur0077313,False,"For the longest time, since first seeing this movie in 1994, I never could place my finger on WHY it has remained one of my all-time favorites.  At first, and most obvious, was that it was a Stephen King screenplay, as I love how Mr. King writes, not from the horror aspect but from the suspense aspect.  This is a jail movie, and I have never really liked jail movies, they just never interested me.  However, this film was much more than a jail movie.  My growing interests in the visual and written arts, and continuing study thereof has made me consciously aware of WHY this is one of my all-time favorites.The Shawshank Redemption, you can even speculate from its title,""Redemption"", that there is a struggle with humanity going on here. This film is largely based on the human condition, and the struggle for this man, Andy, to not lose his humanity in his incarceration.Through a series of events, too much to elaborate on in this 1000 word limit by IMDB, Andy overcomes the emotional and physical barriers of his imprisonment to find his peace by means of a daring and well calculated in years of preparation, plan which puts the warden and certain guards in the hands of real justice finally.  All these characters in this film, are so deep, that each one really deserves his own critical analysis.  This is a must see movie, and not one you can watch once.  You have to watch it several times to grasp what the writers have put forth.  It is truly one of those films that comes along out of nowhere, and has a great impact but is not recognized for what it really is.  As is all great art at the time, that illustrates the struggle of humanity and the human condition.  Kudos to Stephen King for this gift.",10,EXCELLENT.  Shawshank Redemption is a phenomenal film about the human condition and a man's battle to not lose his humanity.

7 January 2016,tt0111161,ur62155607,False,"One of my all time favorites. Shawshank Redemption is a very moving story about hope and the power of friendship. Out of the three genre-defining classics released in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption was the one that ended up bearing the maximum brunt. First commercially by failing to recover its budget for it debuted in theatres together with one of cinema's greatest watershed events; Pulp Fiction. And then at Academy Awards where it was nominated for seven Oscars yet failed to win any, thanks to the sweeping show by the critics' darling, Forrest Gump.But life ever since has been very kind to this film, and both critics & viewers have embraced its uplifting story of hope & friendship with remarkable amount of respect, love & kindness. Today, The Shawshank Redemption enjoys a position that's arguably even higher than the two classics which eclipsed it back in 1994 and while it was discarded at its time of release, it is now rightly & universally acknowledged as one of the greatest films of all time.The Shawshank Redemption tells the story of Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, who is wrongfully convicted of murdering his wife & her illicit lover and is ultimately sentenced to two consecutive life terms in prison where his coping with the brutal hardships of confined life slowly earns him the respect of his fellow inmates & prison staff, including that of ""Red"" in whom Andy finds a trusted ally. The remainder of the film explores their friendship over the next two decades.Written & directed by Frank Darabont, this prison drama is a simple but profoundly moving tale of hope, friendship & redemption that'll manage to connect deeply with most of us in one way or another plus it also marks Darabont's directional debut and he couldn't have asked for a better start. All this film has is men in either prison or police uniforms talking to one another over the course of its runtime and yet it never looked dull or felt like dragging at any given moment.Cinematography exquisitely captures the monotonous daily life inside prison and provides considerable depth & realism to the era this film is set in. Every moment of despair has a shadowy appearance while moments of hope gleam with light. Editing is spectacular too as the gradual progression of Andy's life, his friendship with Red, and his determination to not give in to the four walls containing him is effectively unfolded. And Thomas Newman's score beautifully blends with the film's tone & characters' lives, and is emotionally fulfilling.Coming to the performances, Tim Robbins delivers a swashbuckling performance as Andy Dufresne, the banker wrongfully convicted for the crime he didn't commit. And if Robbins is at his best, then Morgan Freeman is even better as Red, Andy's friend who is also serving a life sentence & is notorious amongst the inmates for he can smuggle goods into the prison. Freeman also narrates the story to us at which he does an even better job. His work is grounded & can go easily unnoticed, but the character of Red is the soul of this story.There is a reason why this film still connects with so many people & why many of them have latched on to it. There is a reason why even after two decades, its legacy keeps flourishing & viewers keep returning to it despite its low entertainment value. One major reason is that even though The Shawshank Redemption is a prison drama, its story of imprisonment goes far beyond the bricks & steel rods of a jail house. The entire picture is a reflection of our own imprisonment in the institutions of our daily lives; institutions like work, family, society etc & living up to the expectations of each one of them.On an overall scale, The Shawshank Redemption stresses that based on the outlook of life, there are only two types of people: one who can be free even in prison while others who find themselves imprisoned even in freedom. The message it is trying to resonate is clear: Fear can hold you prisoner, Hope can set you free. And if we all give ourselves some hope, there is nothing we can't survive. Yes, it all seems preachy n everything, but then if there's ever been a motion picture that has earned this sort of right, it's The Shawshank Redemption. Strongly recommended.",10,excellent movie
24 September 1999,tt0111161,ur0413497,False,"Years ago I decided to start collecting Stephen King paperback editions (and reading them, too) to prop up my excellent English. I'd found out that in the horror genre, everything that had something to do, had the label 'Stephen King' or 'John Carpenter' on it. Luckily both (as in 'Cat's Eye). But as I introduced myself with Mr. King's works I found out that the Enchantment in it isn't in the gore (which he describes splendidly, meaning that I can smell the rottening human flesh despite the fact that my nose exists only for cosmetical reasons) but the professional skill to tell a story. King gets paid by the page, so nowadays he's apt to write stories up to three bricks thick before his eyes wear out. Luckily, his best stories to be filmed are the ones that don't need 'overwriting',nor 'overfilming' as in mini-TV-series as 'The Stand', 'Golden Years', and so on. The best way for Stephen King to make an original story for a movie seems to be to: 1) keep it compact and 2) stay out of intestines, awkward smells and anything that comes out of your body when you're dead). We saw 'Stand by me me' already and 'Dolores Claiborne' afterwards, but this is the upmost number one. When King tells a little story in size of a novelette with no hurry at all, there should be nothing to add. But: then comes the movie with its more than perfect casting plus the original serenity maintained! I conclude my speech with saying that no other movie ever has collected full 10 points, horror or not.",10,The best King films omit the gore
15 January 2016,tt0111161,ur64910185,True,"So, 'The Shawshank Redemption'. Where do I start? The 1994 prison drama based on the Steven King novella 'Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption', from his 1982 collection 'Different Seasons'. Andy Dufresne, a banker from Maine, is convicted for the double murder of his wife and her lover, a crime he did not commit. He is sent to Shawshank State Penitentiary to serve a life sentence. There, he meets Red, a prisoner who smuggles items from the outside world. Andy, who had been an amateur geologist before being jailed, asks Red to get him a rock hammer for shaping rocks he collects from the exercise yard into small sculptures. One of the next items he orders from Red is a large poster of Rita Hayworth. Over the ensuing years, Andy regularly requests more posters from Red, including pin-ups of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. When asked, Andy tells Red that he likes to imagine he can step through the pictures and be with the actresses. So now you've got a basic overview; let's get into the protagonist and of this fictional prison tale - Andy Dufresnse. As previously stated, Andy is a banker from Maine. At first sight Andy comes across an icy and cold man, whilst in the court room; causing the viewer to lean towards deeming him guilty, rather than innocent. The saying 'Never judge a book by its cover' springs to mind in this instance. We find out Andy is a well educated and extremely crafty gentleman because of his ability to sculpt small rocks with a rock hammer, and his knack for self-education through reading books.A pivotal character in this films plot is Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding; of whom interestingly - is of Irish heritage; hence the last name 'Redding'. As you may have picked up his nickname is'Red and it is a play on words ofhis last name. He was sent to Shawshank Prison in Maine in 1927, because he planned and carried out his wife's murder by disabling her brakes which accidentally killed a neighbour and child as well, which earned him a life sentence at Shawshank Prison. In the film he is known as the 'guy who can get things' as he regularly smuggles many items into the prison with help from others. Also, a very craft and intelligent man.It is also an incredibly moving story, which makes you ponder what it'd be like to feel as trapped as the prisoners, and to feel the desperation they would have. Not to ruin the plot completely but 'Red' described himself as 'institutionalised', which made him feel like he'd struggle to exist outside the walls of Shawshank. To me, It's a powerful, poignant and thought-provoking film like no other; which truly has the ability to alter your outlook on life, and I believe it could change it in a positive way as it teaches you to be grateful for the life you have, as some others are much worse off than you are. I also admire the attention given to the story, which no other movie that I have watched has quite done. And that is why I consider it as one of my all-time favourites.",10,"Powerful, poignant and thought-provoking."

I never really understood why everyone watched and spoke of great things about that movie until now. After watching Shawshank Redemption, it really opened my mind to a lot of different things. This movie not only provided, the drama and crime, but it also provided action and even a mystery. This movie is about a man who had a successful career as a banker; however, one day he came home to find out that his wife was having an affair with him. In anger he decided to pull out a revolver and fix the problem himself. So later on he is then accused of first-degree murder and sentenced to two life terms in prison. While in prison the banker had a series of obstacles he had to overcome, especially being a rich guy who had everything he wanted to be a convict who is stripped away from their life. After a few years in Shawshank Prison, the banker finally began to get acclimated. Later on, it did not take long for the banker to hear that he may be innocent and then try to devise a plan to show his innocence that just may or may not work. The main characters in this film were played as, Morgan Freeman and Tim Robbins; thus in my opinion, were outstanding actors and really portrayed their characters as if it were them living that life. I believe that the director of this film did a great job in producing such an awesome movie. This review is actually very hard to write because there is so many emotions I feel after watching the movie. How be ever, the movie offered a great deal of implied metaphors such as when Morgan Freeman uses slang to describe his feelings towards other inmates which allowed the audience to constantly sit on the edge of their seat not knowing what might happen next. This movie may not be your modern era film, but it definitely made an impact on the reality of life. The director, Frank Darabont, definitely put a lot of emphasis on how Tim Robbins' character was influenced by others throughout the movie. Same goes with Morgan Freeman, his character in this movie impacted a lot of people either in a negative way or even a positive way. In Shawshank Redemption, I think by the setting taken place in a prison really presented a more ""harsh times"" feel to the movie such as sexual harassment and brutal beatings by guards. Also I really enjoyed how every little phrase or word, both by an inmate or a guard, stood out and brought a different meaning to the movie. When you watch this movie you must pay attention to every little detail. If you don't, then you will be lost and continue to ask yourself, ""What is going on?"" That's just how it is with Shawshank Redemption. In this movie you would think it would be just your average prison film but it's not. I would recommend this movie to anyone that is interested in a good mystery/action and even a drama. This is an outstanding movie and I'm so glad I watched it because it definitely opened my mind about the reality of life's struggles.",10,The Shawshank Redemption

The film speaks of hope, and the film's two main characters debate throughout the movie about it. One character believes that, in prison, hope is dangerous, and that it should not be used because it will simply make life tougher. Another character believes that hope is needed, because it helps you to keep pushing for a better tomorrow when one does not appear to be in sight.While very engaging and immensely entertaining, this film would not be held to such high regards if not for the twist ending, which is one of the greatest movie endings of all time, in my opinion. If the ending is merely average, this film would simply be considered good, possibly great, but not the masterpiece that it is today.

18 January 2008,tt0111161,ur4133887,False,"Along with The Green Mile, another excellent Frank Darabont adaptation of a Stephen King story, Shawshank is a masterful and thought provoking film.Everyone in Shawshank is innocent you see - except Red (Morgan Freeman). The casting for this film, like Green Mile, is nigh on perfect and helps to create a fully believable tale about one man's fight to prove his innocence against a system that doesn't even care.Morgan Freeman is masterful in his role as Red, one of his best ever, and despite originally intended to be an Irishman (you would expect Caucasian) is brilliant. See Driving Miss Daisy to re-affirm his acting skills.Tim Robbins, as Andy Dufresne, is excellently cast in the role of an innocent man, a successful banker, jailed for two life terms (in 1948) for the murder of his wife and her lover. Being innocent doesn't count and Andy is locked up in the hell-hole Shawshank prison. But his innocence is a driving force. Like a bird - Andy wants to be free.To say the sets are impressive is a major understatement. While the exterior shots are of a renovated Gothic prison, the interiors are nearly entirely built on a sound-stage. The production design is top-notch. You never want to go to a prison like Shawshank.The Warden (Bob Gunton) is a real peace of work - a corrupt official hiding behind The Bible. Clancy Brown (Captain Hadley) is a nice bloke in real life - you would not think it for he is very sinister in this role.Veteran actor James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlen delivers one of his finest performance in his long career - ""institunalised"" after spending most of his life behind bars - 50 at Shawshank. The world all these years later is a shock to Brooks that has sad, no tragic, consequences.Overall this rather long film reeks of quality.

17 April 2009,tt0111161,ur20552756,False,"Shawshank Redemption is without doubt one of the best films ever made, and definitely the best film of 1994. Yes, it is better than Lion King, and I really like that too. It is not only enthralling but powerful and moving too. I will confess that I didn't understand it when I first saw it as a lot happens in the film, and I have now seen it three times. I seriously hope, that those who ignored the film when it was first released now recognise it as a great film, as it really is. The dialogue was extremely well-written, with lines that really stick in your mind. The cinematography and music are both gorgeous, and the prison itself is like a character that dominates the film. In the script, there are some true elements of Stephen King Now I admit I am not a huge king fan, and usually don't like coarse language in books. But in his books like It, which is very good, I have accepted the language represents brutality and rebellion, shown perfectly in the film with the battle of acceptance I suppose between the inmates and the superiors(like the scene with the warden yelling coarse language at the new inmates lined up in a row at the beginning.)The acting was exceptional. I am not hugely familiar with Tim Robbins, but he did a great job in a very demanding role. The best performance however, comes from Morgan Freeman as Red, who was seriously robbed of that Oscar, that he lost to Tom Hanks for Forrest Gump. Freeman reminds me very strongly, or his style of acting does, remind me of that of Sean Connery, suave yet very charismatic. Acting isn't just about your vocal range, it's about depth, which was what Freeman certainly had. In short, Freeman was brilliant in what could be his best performance. The scene where the inmates are listening to the Mozart aria over the speakers was a beautiful profound moment, and I actually cried in Brook's death scene. Very rarely do King adaptations translate-to screen well, because of the large scale of the author's books, with the exception of this and the Shining. Some like It and Dreamcatcher are genuinely memorable but have a number of flaws that prevent them from being classed as outstanding. And some, like Thinner and Tommyknockers that border on unwatchable. In conclusion Shawshank is a brilliant film, that is worthy of the credit it has been denied for so-long. 10/10 of course.

We have a hero, will played by Tim Robbins, pitted against corrupt prison guards and an evil warden. We wonder how he will survive the oppressive prison system and the cruel inmates. This is pretty standard but what makes Shawshank special is the connection between the Robbins character and another inmate in the prison played by Morgan Freeman who also narrates much of the film. The relationship between these two is one of discovery not only of inner strength but also how strong a friendship can be.
Much of The Shawshank Redemption is mood and emotion. We feel terror, heat, boredom and anger. Every aspect of the movie is a quality piece of work to drive home the feelings of the story. The entire cast is very good in how they fit into this closed often horrible world. Along with this praise comes some criticism. In the middle of Shawshank I thought that the pace was too slow. I know we are supposed to see bored inmates but boring the viewer isn't the way to go. I won't give away the ending but it has a fantasy quality about it that just doesn't fit the very real nature of most of the movie. It's a Hollywood ending tacked on to a more serious film.

Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, and the rest of the cast deliver in one of the greatest films ever made in history, at least according to IMDb, it was ranked number one. So how does one review possibly the best movie ever made?The first time I watched Shawshank Redemption I wasn't really impressed, but when I saw it ranked atop the leader board on IMDb, I watched it again, and I agreed with its place. This movie was absolutely fantastic. The story flows and connects really well. The characters are lovable and important to the overall story and by the end it made me just go, ""wow that was awesome."" This is a story of a man named Andy Dufresne who was convicted for the murder of his wife and the man who she had an affair with. When Dufresne arrives in Shawshank he keeps a low profile but struggles with what one would call normal prison problems. He then uses his intelligence of the business world to get on the good side of the guards and the warden. He makes the warden really wealthy and prison life becomes simpler. Then the story develops from there and it is rather complex, but I won't give too much away.I have to start with a few flaws I saw in this movie. The story was a bit slow with a lot of scenes or stories within the major story taking place. In the beginning Andy had problems with the perverts of the prison, or Andy playing the music over the speakers of the prison etc. A few of these stories were pointless and just made me think, ""Why?"" Some were definitely amusing but it is only a small gripe. Maybe if I watch it again I will appreciate them more, but for now it just dragged the story if you ask me. A second problem, and this really bugged me, was the fact that Andy Dufresne entered the prison in 1947 and left in 1966. That is a 19 year period. For a story to last 19 years is not a problem at all, but the fact that the characters do not age annoyed me a lot. Morgan Freeman was supposed to be in his 40s at the start. Now it doesn't matter what decade it is in real life, Morgan Freeman always looks old and wise. And by the end, Freeman didn't really age at all. Sure maybe a gray hair or two, but that was it. Dufresne looked the exact same and so did the Warden. Now some might ask why 19 year storyline but it makes sense if you actually see the movie. The director could have easily added some wrinkles, white hair, something, but there was nothing and it didn't make the time span believable. When Freeman narrates it's 1966 I didn't really believe it. Little details like that are things I can overlook because it is such a fantastic movie but small things like that make an awesome movie a classic movie.The major strength of the movie, in my opinion, is the characters. Dufresne, Red, the warden are the main characters so obviously they will have complexity and lovability, but even smaller characters like Brooks are still important. Brooks showed the prisoner who spends his life in prison and knows nothing else. He is a minor character but he made me think of prison life and prisoners themselves. When he got out of prison he didn't know what to do, he even wanted to stay. He had a minor role with a big impact. Even when he is gone he is remembered and mentioned many times. I really don't remember his name but the character who was the stereotypical 60s man and resembled Elvis was possibly the most important character of all (I'm just going to call him Elvis.). To save spoilers I will only hit the tip of the iceberg. The main story connects with the minor stories told throughout the movie really well but the all seemed pointless until Elvis shows up in Shawshank. He gives Dufresne what he needs and makes the warden put on his evil pants. Basically, he is the turning point of the story and makes it relevant. If you saw the movie you will know exactly what I mean, and if you haven't then go see it so you aren't completely lost. Now the ending was absolutely phenomenal. Throughout the entire move I was thinking what the point was and where it was going, but by the end it is so surprising and personally I thought it was unexpected. It makes you appreciate the idea of storytelling and keeping an audience interested and when I watched it a second time it was one of those times when you think, ""Why didn't I see this coming?"" I love it when movie do that because it makes me think and if a movie makes me think it means I am interested and it does its job of being a good movie.Overall The Shawshank Redemption is a classic, possibly one of the best of all time. Do I think it deserves number one on IMDb's list? No, absolutely not but it should be in the top 10. A bit of a slow start to an amazing story that connects really well, a cast of characters portrayed in depth and detail, and an ending that will possibly blow your mind all form together to form on of, but not the best, movie of all time and without a shadow of a doubt gets the WillyT seal of approval.

This movie has the life in it, you can see the life of a person and the way he reacts to the situation that the fate had pulled him into such a miserable thing.

9 July 2014,tt0111161,ur23931081,False,"1994 was the year I was born. 20 years later I watched The Shawshank Redemption and do not regret it. It is truly one of the best movies of all time. I personally wouldn't put it as #1 in IMDb's top 250 list. There are a ton of movies that are on the same level as The Shawshank Redemption.The story follows Andy Dufresne, a banker who is imprisoned for murdering his wife and her newfound lover. He claims he is innocent but is sentenced anyway. At Shawshank Prison, he meets and becomes friends with a man named Ellis Redding.This entire movie revolves around their relationship as friends and the type of bond they formed while in prison. Both come from different backgrounds: Andy as a successful banker who is wrongly convicted, while Ellis is rightly convicted for murder. The movie has so much depth to these two characters and really fleshes them both out.The Shawshank Redemption is also a very powerful, moving film. Watching the movie, a person might think of Andy Dufresne as a modern ""Jesus"" as to how he is able to convince all of the guards to allow several benefits for each of his friends he meets in prison. He is able to do all of this with no fear as he confronts the main guard Captain Hadley (played in a stunning performance by Clancy Brown). Who knew Dr. Crabs from Spongebob Squarepants could be this cruel.As time goes on at Shawshank, Andy gains the favor of eventually all the guards and has them for protection against a group called The Sisters led by their leader Bogs. The warden even allows Andy to switch his job to help out other inmates in another part of the prison.I must mention the other perfect performances of the other inmates. William Sadler plays Heywood, who is one of Ellis's group of inmates. James Whitmore plays the elderly Brooks Hatlen, who is the oldest member of Ellis's group. Honestly, these two actors have perfect performances. Bob Gunton as Warden Samuel Norton is very sneaky and ruthless. This movie will keep you guessing. Andy asks several times throughout the movie for different items. He gets them, but the viewer is clueless till the end of the movie. Andy does everything to make life at Shawshank enjoyable by doing various deeds throughout the film (despite the protests from the guards and the warden). He doesn't seem to care what others think and seems to do things for others.In the second half of the movie, a new prisoner named Tommy Williams becomes part of Ellis's group. With the arrival of Tommy, truths are revealed.I won't spoil anything about the ending, but Andy has one final surprise for everyone that will shock the viewers and everyone in Shawshank Prison. Like I said earlier in the review, the whole movie revolves around Andy and Ellis's friendship.Stephen King created a novella called Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption which Frank Darabont directed this in his first attempt as director.Thank you Frank Darabont for creating this masterpiece. I also want to thank Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman for portraying Andy Dufresne and Ellis Redding respectively. Thank you Stephen King for writing the book.

3 November 2006,tt0111161,ur11987239,False,"I really liked this movie, which I just recently saw for the first time, strange indeed since it is more than 10 years old. It reminded me, naturally I would say, to Papillon, the 70's McQueen/Hoffman classic.I like the story, the acting, basically everything, and I definitely recommend it to everybody. But compared to Papillon? There are so many similarities that one has to think that idea of the movie did not came out of the blue. Because of that the movie has to accept to be compared with Papillon. And Papillon is simply even better. It is emotionally much more touching, and when even Freeman's great performance doesn't match Hoffman's, there is no doubt that Robbins is not close to McQueen - in that role I mean! Tim gave a great performance but his role didn't give him the chance that Steve had.Anyway, a joy to watch. But please watch the ""original"" too, it's not old-fashioned at all! I can only guess, but I think the huge differential of 9.1 for SR and 7.9 for Papillon is because most young people have never seen Papillon.",7,"A very good film, but it's not Papillon"

For once this is probably the one time that such a cliched plot actually worked. I have personally seen this movie over 20 times just to figure out how and why it works so well.  First of all the story is deep and thought provoking. Morgan Freeman's voice over narrative lets you see it through his eyes (the movie is really about him).

The narrative is always engrossing, the source elements of Andy's secret are carefully placed without exciting attention, and you are delighted when events pan out as they do.Then Darabont adapts it, and a damn good yarn becomes something special. Part of this is the adaptation - a sensitive simplification, part of it is the casting, which is pitch perfect (Morgan Freeman's Red was always an Irish redhead when I read the story - now I can't read it without seeing Morgan Freeman). And most of it, I think, is the direction.The story unfolds in unhurried fashion, with us being unsure of Andy's guilt for much of the movie, but with a gradually building sense of injustice at the way those in power in the system can treat him (and others) unfairly. The secret doesn't come at the end, but at about the three quarters mark, and brings with it a huge emotional kick.

For that reason Andy is supposed to be the killer and Morgan Freeman plays the role of the narrator of the story of Andy (a normal and introverted man) in prison.

This film was adapted from a short story, 'Rita Hayworth and The Shawshank Redemption,' written by Stephen King. Perhaps it is because it's adapted from a short story as to why this works so well as there are only minor changes and nothing essential is left out, leaving the film makers with the ability to strengthen and stretch out the main focus, which is the bond created by the two main characters. In my personal opinion I would say this film is one of the most successful book to script adaptations in film history. The direction is brilliant in the way it is almost not noticeable as it relies on the actors and their interactions with each other to keep the audience interested.

The Shawshank redemption a movie directed by Frank Darabont The Shawshank Redemption is an American drama film made by writer Stephen King from the beginning, with Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman in the lead roles. The film is about the successful banker Andy ( Tim Robbins ) who is wrongly convicted for murder of his wife and her lover. He is sent to Shawshank Prison for life. This is one of the toughest prisons in the United States during the 1940s. There he meets Red ( Morgan Freeman ) as they quickly becomes very good friends. Years after years Andy just gets more and more famous among the guards, and the prisoners, and it ends with Andy helps a guard to get $ 25,000 as a gift. Then the police- officer Norton realizes that Andy might be useful, so he started taking care of the prison economy. It causes him to get control of what happens in the prison and it gives him great opportunities to escape from the prison. The film has a strong and important purpose that you should never give up and always have hopes for what will happen.

It has been top of the ratings since forever, and the user-reviews are superlatives-on-steroids! But can I really have rated 40 or 50 or more that are 8, 9 or 10? Yep! ie - Braveheart, ""Legends of the Fall"".I saw the trailers, and wasn't really impressed - just another US jail pic? So I read some reviews, and saw other clips. Eventually, the local DVD shop had it on a super special, 3 disc set AND the complete script in a book, all for just $5! gosh, the book would have cost that much for the paper? So I doubt if Castle Rock, or Columbia or anyone involved in making it, got a single cent?So I started with disc 3, boring pseudo-interviews with the main actors. Didn't learn much there, and the ""behind the scenes"" clip was only 9 minutes and not very informative, so, to disc 2 and eventually watched the actual film. By now I'm a bit overloaded with superlatives. But then thought about the tiny flaws, ie, Robbins as the main character Andy. Insipid, unconvincing? maybe, doesn't come across as either an innocent inmate, nor as a super clever. Norton the warden looks and sounds more like a small-town bank manager and acts like a modern big city corrupt banker? Hadley, the awful captain of the guard looks more like a ""upwardly mobile professional""?The other inmates are forgettable (except Brooks, the OLD guy). The ""get busy living or get busy dying"" scene confuses me, that is what I call a ""sillyism"". It means whatever you want it to mean.I note that there is almost zero female participation?

6 October 2011,tt0111161,ur4234119,False,"I will never forget the first time I watched ""The Shawshank Redemption"", with my father. Both of us were fans of prison and male-bonding movies, and choose the film only expecting to watch a solid drama. Needless to say that, when the last line was delivered and the TV screen painted the walls with a beautiful blue, the feeling that we had just watched something exceptional instantly cut through our hearts, and before the second viewing, we would regularly mention how great that film ""with the poster"" was.Then I would never miss it whenever I found it on TV, and after each viewing, it unveiled one unsuspected element of its unique appeal. I guess if it doesn't justify, at least it explains why this movie that didn't do well in the theaters, had a better success on VHS, TV and DVD before it would ultimately dethrone ""The Godfather"" from the first place on IMDb Top 250. And it's only justice if ""The Shawshank Redemption"", the least spectacular of the four Best Picture nominees in the glorious 1994, made by a relatively unknown director, a movie with an appeasing and appealing patience, took its time to grow on people and did it pretty well, as if it applied its own philosophy, patiently but determinedly. This is the strength of ""The Shawshank Redemption"", its ability to tell a story that spans a long period of time without trying to get to the so-called essential, the simplest things take their full meanings, the smallest details have their share of importance. And think about it, in a prison where everyone wears the same outfits, where the days are regulated by the same routine, all you can do is to make a life out of this routine, make a place, to get closer to your own definition of 'having a life'. And as we penetrate the impressive walls of Shawshank, from the first vertiginous panoramic shot, we're literally submerged by the solemn austerity of the location, conveying a very hostile feel. These characteristics are perfectly incarnated by the figure of the Warden Samuel Norton, who's like the male alter-ego of Nurse Ratched from ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"". And the comparison with Forman's film isn't fortuitous as Shawshank intends to domesticate its occupants to the same limits of mechanical alienation, to the point that the only thing left to the inmates is to control their only valuable treasure: time, by getting busy, finding their own reason-to-be, like the veteran Brooks (James Whitmore) was the man with the books, Red, remarkably played by Morgan Freeman, was the man who could get you things.In a very intelligent move from the script, the hero of the film, the laconic Andy Dufresne, an upper-class banker, played in all nuance by Tim Robbins, is condemned to a life sentence at Shawshank, for the murder of his wife and her lover. And nothing indicates if he is innocent or guilty and I wondered if any certitude would have conditioned my appreciation of the character. I think it was necessary for us to have a reasonable doubt about his innocence in order to let his character progressively grow on us until we believe by ourselves that he was indeed the victim of unfortunate circumstances, the same feeling that grew in the heart of Red before becoming his best friend. Morgan Freeman is the pillar of the film while Tim Robbins is its free spirit, both allow us in a remarkable complementarity to dream of abstract notions like hope and freedom while being practical and 'busy' in the same time. And again, their friendship is a slow process that takes its time to progress and reaches a pivotal point when Andy was allowed to put his banker's casket again and feels that prison didn't deprive him from his 'social quality'. Shawshank is not slow but more a patience-demanding film with a sense of decency in the way it trusts our intelligence. And the film's motto, on which relies its philosophical core is ""Get busy living or get busy dying"". Now, two things occur to me while writing these lines, a heart-breaking sequence about the inmate Brooks who was freed after 50 years of detention, and who realized he was institutionalized. A notion explained by Red: when the infamous wall that scared you so much becomes your personal guiding light while outside, it's all dark and your time is deconstructed. Brooks couldn't live outside Shawshank so there was no other way he could live. The second thing is the sad passing of Steve Jobs today. And as I was reading his famous Stanford speech, I couldn't help but make a connection with the beautiful message of Darabont's film, an invitation to dream, to escape from any sort of walls or obstacles put in your life and heart with as many dreams as you can fulfill, a notion illustrated by the beautiful scene when Andy put some classical music on the microphone, so the prisoners could for once elevate themselves and having an ephemeral moment of pure freedom, this is the triumph of human spirit, this understanding of the value of life is ""The Shawshank Redemption""In the same vein than ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Shawshank"" is a constant encouragement to fight the system and use time for the best, for whatever constitutes our dreams, being men again, able to enjoy, to feel, to give a meaning to our lives. In other words, hope, hope that things can get better despite the adversity. To quote Steve Jobs : ""Courage is the discovery that you may not win, and trying when you know you can lose."" This is the true intelligence of life, what makes it worth living.""The Shawshank Redemption"" a powerful adaptation of Stephen King's novel is one of the greatest American films: a powerful story of courage, perseverance, hope and ultimately, friendship and humanity.",10,"A Powerful Story of Courage, Perseverance and Friendship ..."

Yes, this film is better than average, but not much, much better.There is an interesting twist to the way that this film approaches its story. Its narrative building blocks are those of the familiar all-male prison tale, but the script operates like an old-fashioned Hollywood women's picture. This allows the movie to explore a series of melodramatic situations, but to people these situations with just men. As a result, even as the movie acts tough, it relentlessly explores its characters' unsatisfied emotional needs. Lots of opportunities for restrained male tears ensue, often to good effect.I know that my next comment is going to anger a lot of readers, but this film's exceedingly high rating on IMDb explains why cultural elites, and not the masses, end up determining which works of art have lasting value.

19 November 2007,tt0111161,ur14735225,True,"I have recently watched The Shawshank Redemption. To put it simply as possible, it is a great piece of movie history.This movie deserves to be where it is (second)on the best Two hundred and fifty greatest films of all time.The Shawshank Redemption is basically about a prisoner, who is in Shawshank prison because of a murder which he didn't commit. The prisoner is a banker called Andy dufresne. As the film shows Andy is a honest man. Andy is also a committed man. Andy is acted by Tim Robbins. Andy Dufresne makes a strong friendship with a man nicknamed Red. Red is acted by Morgan Freeman. I think this movie is on of the best I've ever seen I would rate it 9 out of 10.",9,Great

Kings movies always have a way to confuse you which is an admiring move being that the plot twists are what make a great movie. In my opinion he could have threw in a little less suspense and the movie still would have had as much of a phenomenal turnout. The quality is fantastic.

I then read a book called 1001 movies you must see before you die and of course, this was one of the movies. I decided to make a list and start making movies off.

This film is just incredible in how it captured the spirit of ordinary people caught up in the prison system which is still in place to this day. We refer to it as the meat grinder. The film captures how people, through their own misfortunes and circumstances have found themselves in prison, even though they might not be a 'criminal' in essence. the emotion of the film is just awesome and this is why it will always be referred to when anyone is talking about prison or prison films. the ultimate classic film.",10,What was prison life like and has it changed?

On the other hand, it is all played very natural, for me it doesn't feel like I am watching a movie, it's like I am watching someone's memories. The way the director and writers have put this movie together, it gives me the idea I am there with them. Also, the way Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman show their emotions, you can see they are first-class actors. It is 2 hours and 20 minutes of sympathizing with the main character. There are so many lessons in this movie which you can use in the modern days. If possible, I'll show this movie to my children and try to let them explain why the choices were made and ask for their opinion.",10,My number one

You simply haven't lived until you have seen this movie and although i loved every character in this movie, Morgan freeman definitely did it for me. It leaves you realising that after a long time in prison, it must be extremely intimidating to be set free in what is a crazy world and leaving a hard but familiar life behind. I have never been to prison and never want to but its quite an insight I'm sure to how you develop a routine and a life in there. If you only ever want to see one movie in your time then make this the one, if i was doing desert island discs, then this would be the movie i take with me without a doubt.

14 June 2013,tt0111161,ur38008272,True,"There is a reason the Shawshank Redemption has been at #1 of the IMDb top 250 for as long as I can remember. It is probably the best movie that has ever been made. Not because of the thrilling special effects (it hardly has any). Not because of the daring, experimental innovations it has brought us (it is a quite straightforward movie). But because of its simple, beautiful storyline and its great characters.""They send you here for life. That's exactly what they take."" The strength of this movie is that Darabont is able to show what it means to completely lose are perspective and dreams for the future. To show how the people inside shed off their old lives and get used to the terrible life in Shawshank prison. We can truly understand how a man can become 'institutionalized.' How people get used to living under a repressive regime and can't face changing it. We see how the old Brooks can't deal with the world around him and commits suicide. How Red faces the same challenges when he can't take a leak without asking permission. Inside the joint these men had a certain standing, they were important people. Being set free is not easy when your live has been taken from you.""Why did you do it? - I didn't, since you ask. - You gonna fit right in.""Half of the movie we don't know for sure whether Andy is guilty or not. It doesn't matter so much. What is important is not his past. Rehabilitated? What does that word even mean? In prison you live a whole different life. With whole different rules. Without a past. Or a future. Andy is the exemption. He shows us the remedy against becoming institutionalized. By never accepting our destiny. By never giving up. By always keeping our dreams alive.""- There are places in the world that aren't made out of stone. There is something inside that they can't touch. - What are you talking about? -Hope. - Let me tell you something my friend, hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane. You better get used to that idea.""But Andy doesn't get used to that idea. He has received two things by the warden. ""Discipline and the bible."" And he uses these two things to get out and escape to the paradise called Zihujataneo. There are two things that make this movie so extremely good. The first thing is that we all can relate to Andy. ""I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him. He had a quit way about him. A walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.""Andy is a normal guy. He is smart, he is doing good. But he is not extremely strong, or extremely smart, or extremely rich. In other words: he is us. He is elevated a little bit above the criminals in prison, but his two most important characteristics are characteristics that, deep down inside us, we all have: hope and determination. These two emotion are so strong and so pure, that we all love to see the live of Andy. That is what makes this movie so appealing.And by living just your live as best as you can, by never giving up and by keeping your dignity at all times, we see that we can inspire people. Brooks was here. So was Red. Red didn't choose that path of Brooks. Red hasn't become completely institutionalized. Because he lived with Andy and dreamed a bit of his dreams.We, the normal movie-watchers, have never been to prison. And certainly, there is nobody who can play the role of an older brother as the great Morgan Freeman, and this might be his best performance of his live. Darabont shows a lot of skill in movie-directing and can let years pass in his movie without one moment losing our attention. There is a great soundtrack, which breathes the smell of Southern America into our living rooms. But I'm convinced that what makes this movie so great is that it inspires us all.We are not stuck in a prison, but certainly we can be stuck in our lives. Change is hard and also outside of prison it is possible to become institutionalized. We can have a life that seems to have no past and not future. That seems to be unrelated to all the other things that happen in the world. Andy learns us to never give up. To never lose faith. To always keep hoping and dreaming about paradise.""I guess it comes down to a simple choice. Get busy living or get busy dying.""",10,Probably the best movie ever

Morgan Freeman is topnotch as always, and so is James Whitmore. Real professionals. So is Bob Gunton, the warden.

This film will touch your mind, heart and soul, and the actors do a wonderful job of not only becoming an embodiment of their characters but also create and maintain memorable impressions.

This is a movie that everyone has to see. We in life deal with our own struggles and unfairness. While here we get the amazing effect that justice does happen with enough perseverance. Freedom is a fundamental right to all people and atonement is to be found for crimes committed. There comes a point in all prisoners lives where they are truly sorry for their crimes. This is not the main line of this movie but the idea comes across very well. truth will come out and you may find a time where there will be honourable people listening to what we have to say, even if that honour comes out after a sentence is served.

27 October 2016,tt0111161,ur69473998,False,"Before we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption, we first have to deal with The Shawshank Reputation. In addition to its Oscar nominations and huge critical acclaim, the film has topped the IMDb Top 250 for years and shows no signs of dropping off any time soon. Any attempt to criticise it could come across as churlish or contrarian, the work of someone attempting to be above what is popular for their own self-righteous sake. Fortunately, there is little need to criticise - for Shawshank really is as great as people make it out to be. It's easy to forget how much of a slow- burning success Shawshank was. Despite favourable reviews and its many nominations, the film barely broke even on first release. It was only with the VHS release that word began to spread like wildfire, so that by the turn of the century it had garnered a reputation as a modern American great. In an age where films are dead in the water if they don't perform on opening weekend, it is hard to imagine a situation in which another Shawshank could emerge (although Slumdog Millionaire is a reasonable candidate). It's equally easy to forget how brutal the film is, particularly in its first 20 minutes. Shawshank's reputation as a popular favourite might lead the uninitiated to thinking that it's an uplifting, feel- good film - and it is true that these later moments are the ones which have most entered into popular consciousness. But any film about hope needs a source of despair to provide conflict, and Shawshank has more than enough violence and emotional trauma to justify its 15 certificate. As Mark Kermode famously remarked, there's a whole lot of Shawshank before the Redemption. Even without its reputation, Shawshank is one of the best adaptations of Stephen King's work. Indeed, among King's dramatic stories, it is outshone only by its successor The Green Mile. Frank Darabont has a greater understanding of King than almost any other filmmaker: he gets the tone spot on and recreates the period setting brilliantly with the help of Roger Deakins' cinematography. Despite the much-parodied narration that punctuates the film, the drama unfolds naturally and believably throughout, with the characters always being at the forefront and naked exposition being kept to a bare minimum. Shawshank is a good example of how adaptation works - or more specifically, how changes made to the original story in translation often benefit the finished product. The best example of this is the character of Red, who in the original novel is a red-headed Irishman. This is referred to jokingly by Morgan Freeman in one of his first conversations with Tim Robbins; when Andy asks why people call him Red, Red responds: ""Maybe it's because I'm Irish."". On top of Freeman's obvious ability, the casting decision makes sense because it adds an extra layer of meaning to the character. Red is one of the few black characters we come across; while he applies himself in different ways, he is as much of an outsider as Andy DuFresne. This is borne out by his remarks about institutionalisation, which are laughed off by his fellow inmates. Red may be well-connected when it comes to smuggling things in, but otherwise he is just as lonely as Andy. Shawshank approaches the theme of institutionalisation with great grace and dexterity. Because the story takes place over three decades, the temptation would be to canter through the plot points and cut straight to Andy's escape - you could even stage the entire story in flashback.",9,"Before we can critically assess The Shawshank Redemption, we first have to deal with The Shawshank Reputation"

I mean how many times have we seen a movie about some guy, in this case Andy Defresne played by Tim Robbins, being sent to prison because he murdered his wife and then many years later he escapes using a spoon or something to escape from the prison. The acting isn't really great, the story is flat like a pancake, and Frank Darabont's direction really shows that this was a first-time effort. The movie is absolutely WAY too predictable, the title The Shawshank Redemption already gives away the ending of the movie, which I felt way too cheesy and fake to believe.

Jim Sheridan's ""In the Name of the Father"" springs immediately to mind.

What's even more heartening is that it's also true.Like I said, I'm not dissing the film. it IS great.

Staff face out of the room I can not forget: the satisfaction of the idiot. Silly happy face. Happy to have been part of something big, and silly because you can not yet comment on anything until this very nice feeling to go away.But the biggest thing is the last half hour. When I was asking God knows who, who Shawshank lasted longer, I gave that to me is the best outcome of the history of cinema, for the duration of your footage, for as tying each of the ends and being splendidly filmed.

Word of mouth was the most resounding success of The Shawshank Redemption. ""Hey, you have to go see that movie, it's amazing ..."" or something like that, I guess.Based on a story by Stephen King, Darabont adapted a masterful script that was his debut. This film, say the gossip, impressed especially teens and twenties for having one of the best stories of friendship between men. Accustomed to see tough guys who crashed five, forced here to look with new eyes the protagonists and its history, just hallucinated. Personally, I think it is the most beautiful ever told about the friendship between two men history. Morgan Freeman, as we did in Million Dollar Baby, is the main character who narrates throughout the film the adventures of his friend, in the end you realize that you knew nothing.I think Morgan Freeman plays the role of his life here, not Driving Miss Daisy or Million Dollar Baby. The same Tim Robbins, his absent expressiveness think that came in handy Dufresne's character. Side, all luxury: the perfect warden, orderlies ditto captain, James Whitmore -the unforgettable older-, game of prisoners who accompanies our friends as much. All perfect. A great address with them.

""The Shawshank Redemption"", no matter how cliché it might seem, is one of the best stories I've ever seen on film. It is beautiful and shocking, funny and sad, desperate and hopeful - all at the same time. Though the story may not start off too clear, it masterfully unfolds along the course of the movie, and leads to a magnificent, satisfying ending. A great decision was casting Morgan Freeman for this film; additionally to his beautiful, poetic narration, for me it remains one of his definitive roles - Ellis ""Red"" Redding, an aged prison inmate, who seems to have been in Shawshank for most of his life and has come to peace with his fate, until he meets that wonderful young man, Andy Dufresne, who significantly changes not only Red's life, but the lives of everybody in Shawshank. This movie, of course, has a few drawbacks, just a few little plot holes which aren't really a big deal, but the main idea of the movie compensates for them very well.There is a reason this movie is so well-loved. If you just sum up the script, it is a very simple story. But this story is full of emotion, conflict, feelings, and most of all - hope. The main theme of this movie is hope - the light that shines in each and every one of Shawshank's inmates, and the brightest of all - in Andy.

Absorbing plot, interesting relationship between the two leads. The prison system (of Maine) exposed as brutal and corrupt, the chief guard (sadist) and the warden (sanctimonious bible basher) are particularly nasty. Setting the story between the 40s and 60s makes it a little easier to believe. Fairytale ending.Conservatives might argue all the brutality is justified in making prison a deterrent, but that hardly excuses the murders by guards and embezzlement by the warden. Of course the same people will contend insider trading keeps the stock market efficient  laws are OK as long as they do not inconvenience entrepreneurs. What we see here is a criminal injustice system similar to that which prevailed in parts of Australia at the time (and probably still does). The public doesn't care and the politicians don't want to appear soft on crime, after all, only bad people go to prison. Actually, King accepts that some prisoners have done pretty awful things, and go on doing them in prison.So who is being redeemed? The problem is that Tim Robbin's character is a moral and upright character who should not be in jail  he has no need to forgive himself. Most of the other prisoners seem to think they are innocent, which makes ""redemption"" hard for them. Perhaps Morgan Freeman's character eventually does, but at enormous cost.

He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff.

Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne delivers the perfect combination of hope and despair, so that you can love his character without ever truly knowing what he shall do next. Morgan Freeman brings subtlety and depth to a character who would perhaps otherwise be much simpler. Bob Gunton allows you to genuinely fear Warden Norton, and if James Whitmore's performance does not make you lachrymose, nothing can.The plot is beautiful, describing the redemption of many an inmate. Red, though he does not escape institutionalization, becomes a good man. Tommy Williams does the same.

5 November 1998,tt0111161,ur0151385,False,"While the acting is rather good, not all performances are flawless, nor matched with each other as well as they could be (see Godfather 1 and 2, Goodfella's, even Pulp Fiction for near flawless ensemble acting in films).The film works but is a multi-derivative film, borrowing similar characters from several films and fashioning a film of fairly corny and unbelievable melodramatic moments to ultimately preach a message of hope.While it's an entertaining film, it's not a very good film at all.  It's strongest moments are borrowed from prison films as far back as 1930's Up the River which starred Spencer Tracy and Humphrey Bogart (in his second role).   While Shawshank is superior overall than some of the film it borrows from, it does not go any place other films have not already been before.  While at times it borders on being brutal, it still is completely done with a rose colored glasses sensibility.  Were it to more accurately portray any semblance of what the situation would be like it would be at times very difficult to watch and emotionally exhausting--which this film is not.I am rather surprised it has received such high praise from so many.  I suppose if voters would see films such as Attica, Breaker Morant, Brubaker, Cool Hand Luke, Cry Danger, The Glass House, Papillon, Pressure Point (1962), Riot in Cellblock 11, Short Eyes, and Yol for starters (films which concern men who are prisoners), they would realize how much of this film is borrowed from prior films.",6,"Above average, but not great."

1 August 2013,tt0111161,ur45527579,False,"I think this movie is very meaningful. I like it very much. You must think so too. You must all have a lot to say. But according to what we have appointed, Im the Chair, so please let me show you my opinion first. The story begins with the trial of a young banker, Andy Dufrense, victimized by circumstantial evidence, resulting in a conviction for the murder of his wife and her lover. After a quick conviction, Andy finds himself serving a life sentence at Shawshank prison, with no hope of parole. He exists in this prison only in appearance, keeping his mind free from the drab walls around him. His ability to do this results in the gaining of respect from his fellow inmates, but most of all from Ellis Redding. Ellis, commonly referred to as Red, finds gainful use of his entrepreneurial spirit within the drab walls of Shawshank by dealing in contraband and commodities rare to the confines of prison. Andy\'s demeanor and undeniable sense of hope causes Red to take a deeper look at himself, and the world around him. Andy proves to Red and the other inmates that in the conventional walls of Shawshank prison convention will find no home in his lifestyle. As far as Im concerned, this movie shows us three things: freedom, friendship, and hope. If we take a movie as a novel, then Shawshank Redemption is a great novel without doubt. It reflects the real social life, and creates several typical characters with Classic Quotes and a few kinds of modifications. This movie organizes the main scenario of the story in a simple way and at the same time using some petty lines. It expresses the subject in a very artistic way. There were three words, the first is freedom. However, what impressed me is nearly everyone in the prison got accustomed to the prison life. Whats more, an old man even suicide after he was set free. I have a very deep feeling of friendship. The second word accrued to me is friendship. Friendship is a necessary in our life. In this movie, the friendship between Andy and Red moved me. It gave me an idea: getting a real friendship is more important than money and power. Friendship is really important, and in my opinion, it is very hard to get a real friendship. When we don't have a real friend, we will feel very lonely. I may have this feeling during these days. That is really incredibly hard. Also there are some sentences in the movie that really impressed me. The sentence I like most is hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies. Because I think, it encourages people appreciate the beauty of life, to keep their hope in heart forever. It was as if some beautiful birds had flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away, and for the briefest of moments, every last man in Shawshank felt free. From this sentence, I start to know that, in fact, something cannot be noticed at all. That is like the freedom of our heart. We need it, just like you have never forgotten it. Another one is: Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free. A strong man can save himself. A great man can save another. I like this sentence because it teaches me to let me full of courage and hopes. It urges me to have the determination to succeed. In the end, I want to use a sentence to summarize this movie: Fear can hold you prisoner. Hope can set you free.",10,The discussion on Shawshank Redemption

It made no real impact at the academy award either. So why is this movie currently holding the second spot at the imdb top 250, only beaten by the untouchable ""Il Padrino""? First of all, I believe the movie is spot on when it comes to the description of human endurance, persistence, and adaptation. The development of the characters also indicates that imprisonment and freedom can't always be divided by walls alone. Sometimes the highest walls and the worst conditions aren't enough to stop the human spirit, other times the absence of boundaries and even the prospect of something better, can break you down if you lack some of your primal needs. This is where I believe the greatness of this movie really shows. It perfectly pinpoints the vast scope of the human mind, and how we react both similar and differently to challenges in life, and the movie does so in a simple, straightforward way!

The only other movie I have ever seen that effects me as strongly is To Kill a Mockingbird. Both movies leave me feeling cleaner for having watched them.I didn't intend to see this movie at all: I do not like prison movies and I don't normally watch them. I work at a branch library and one day as I was checking The Shawshank Redemption out to one of our older patrons, she said to me, ""Whenever I feel down or depressed, I check out this movie and watch it and it always makes me feel better."" At the time, I thought that was very strange. One day there was nothing on TV except things I absolutely would not watch under any circumstance or things that I had seen too many times already.

It is simply a must to pay a great respect to the main protagonists  experienced Morgan Freeman as Red, a man who will provide you with everything you need, and irreplaceable Tim Robbins as Andy Dufresne, a banker who was unjustly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover.The story starts in the late 1940's when a banker Andy Dufresne is sentenced to two consecutive life sentences at the Shawshank State Penitentiary for murdering his wife and her lover. He instantly becomes a friend with a contraband smuggler and the film's narrator Ellis ""Red"" Redding who procures a rock hammer for Andy so he can create small stone chess pieces. Soon, Andy unleashes his financial skills when he overhears the merciless guard chief Hadley complaining about taxes. Thanks to his former occupation, Andy is given a position in the library so he can manage financial matters for Shawshank. As the years pass, Norton, the head of the prison, uses the library and public works worked by prison labor to undercut skilled labor costs so he can receive huge kickbacks. Andy is used for laundering the money using the alias ""Randall Stephens"". In the mid-1960's young Tommy Williams, an irredeemable burglar, is imprisoned. He gets close with Andy and Red and when hearing the details of Andy's case begins to talk about his former inmate. He explains that the inmate told him how he had killed two people and got away with it which seems to be a proof of Andy's innocence. Unfortunately, as soon as Norton hears a word about it, he has young Tommy shot by Hadley. This appears to be enough for Andy. He tells Red about his secret dream of living in a Mexican coastal village and instructs him how to get there when he is free. The next day, Andy's cell is found empty. Norton and the guards find out that Andy escaped through a tunnel which he had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. While they are searching for him, Andy, as Randall Stephens, visits a large number of banks to withdraw the laundered money. Besides that, he sends a package with evidence of what has happened at the prison to a regional newspaper. Will the police and the newspaper trust Andy? Will he and Red ever meet again? Go and watch the bravura ending.It is hard to find a more proper word for the film than a masterpiece. The Shawshank Redemption is an opportunity to witness how fate is the best judge in the end, how a frightened cat can turn into a brave lion and how a friendship can be developed even in the darkest moments of ones' lives. Next, I was really impressed by the perfect narrating skills of Mr. Freeman. The actor's storytelling keeps you deeply settled in your seat and you are able to literally breathe the story. I haven't seen such a well-thought-out plot like this in a long time. The diligent work of the producers, cameramen, costume designers, make-up and hair stylists and all of the crew will be remembered. I can't write this without mentioning the set. I have already talked about it, but I need to praise it a little bit more. It was so easy to get into the plot thanks to the set  you do not get a chance to doubt the realism of the scenery. Another aspect to be spotlighted is the soundtrack. Magnificent Thomas Newman and his team produced a piece of quality material which does not stay unnoticed and bonds you even more with the whole drama. Last but not least, I must applaud the directing and screen writing of Mr. Darabont who created a completely unique and new experience for TV viewers and cinema audiences. We can only guess what happens in the end until we finally get to see the finish line of Shawshank. I guarantee you will end up with a wide smile on your face.To sum up, we can only thank the entire crew for the spectacular project with an inspiring story of not giving up. The conclusion of my review is as brief as it can be  go and book your place in front of the big screen! You will not regret it. The massive number of emotions you can experience while watching The Shawshank Redemption will make you laugh or cry whenever you want.",9,"""Get busy living, or get busy dying."" - Andy Dufresne"
20 January 2017,tt0111161,ur71570721,False,"This is the best movie that I have ever seen! Shawshank spent unbelievable twenty years digging his way to the freedom which is pretty impressive. He took advantage of his special skills to gain the trust of warden and captain. I almost burst to cry when I saw he and his friends drinking most delicious beer on the roof with wind breezing softly. He could never be bent, even though his enemies kept attacking him. I really wished he could be free with the help of that boy. However, the warden would exploit him to death and wouldn't ever let Shawshank go free. If the truth was that Shawshank was innocent, then the warden would rewrite the truth to keep Shawshank around him and working. After all his efforts, I was very happy to see Shawshank had another beautiful and decent life!",10,Never be institutionalized
25 September 2015,tt0111161,ur50322850,True,"The story is narrated by ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), who has been inside the walls of Shawshank Prison for a very long time and is its leading entrepreneur. He can get you whatever you need: cigarettes, candy, even a little rock pick like an amateur geologist might use. One day he and his fellow inmates watch the latest bus load of prisoners unload, and they make bets on who will cry during their first night in prison, and who will not. Red bets on a tall, lanky guy named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), who looks like a babe in the woods.But Andy does not cry, and Red loses the cigarettes he wagered. Andy turns out to be a surprise to everyone in Shawshank, because within him is such a powerful reservoir of determination and strength that nothing seems to break him. Andy was a banker on the outside, and he's in for murder. He's apparently innocent, and there are all sorts of details involving his case, but after a while they take on a kind of unreality; all that counts inside prison is its own society -- who is strong, who is not -- and the measured passage of time.Red is also a lifer. From time to time, measuring the decades, he goes up in front of the parole board, and they measure the length of his term (20 years, 30 years) and ask him if he thinks he has been rehabilitated. Oh, most surely, yes, he replies; but the fire goes out of his assurances as the years march past, and there is the sense that he has been institutionalized -- that, like another old lifer who kills himself after being paroled, he can no longer really envision life on the outside.Red's narration of the story allows him to speak for all of the prisoners, who sense a fortitude and integrity in Andy that survives the years. Andy will not kiss butt. He will not back down. But he is not violent, just formidably sure of himself. For the warden (Bob Gunton), he is both a challenge and a resource; Andy knows all about bookkeeping and tax preparation, and before long he's been moved out of his prison job in the library and assigned to the warden's office, where he sits behind an adding machine and keeps tabs on the warden's ill-gotten gains. His fame spreads, and eventually he's doing the taxes and pension plans for most of the officials of the local prison system.There are key moments in the film, as when Andy uses his clout to get some cold beers for his friends who are working on a roofing job. Or when he befriends the old prison librarian (James Whitmore). Or when he oversteps his boundaries and is thrown into solitary confinement. What quietly amazes everyone in the prison -- and us, too -- is the way he accepts the good and the bad as all part of some larger pattern than only he can fully see.The partnership between the characters played by Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman is crucial to the way the story unfolds. This is not a ""prison drama"" in any conventional sense of the word. It is not about violence, riots or melodrama. The word ""redemption"" is in the title for a reason. The movie is based on a story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption, by Stephen King, which is quite unlike most of King's work. The horror here is not of the supernatural kind, but of the sort that flows from the realization than 10, 20, 30 years of a man's life have unreeled in the same unchanging daily prison routine.The director, Frank Darabont, paints the prison in drab grays and shadows, so that when key events do occur, they seem to have a life of their own.Andy, as played by Robbins, keeps his thoughts to himself. Red, as Freeman plays him, is therefore a crucial element in the story: His close observation of this man, down through the years, provides the way we monitor changes and track the measure of his influence on those around him. And all the time there is something else happening, hidden and secret, which is revealed only at the end.""The Shawshank Redemption"" is not a depressing story, although I may have made it sound that way. There is a lot of life and humor in it, and warmth in the friendship that builds up between Andy and Red. There is even excitement and suspense, although not when we expect it. But mostly the film is an allegory about holding onto a sense of personal worth, despite everything. If the film is perhaps a little slow in its middle passages, maybe that is part of the idea, too, to give us a sense of the leaden passage of time, before the glory of the final redemption.",10,Beautiful art movie
18 June 2011,tt0111161,ur24573739,False,"When I saw that the Shawshank Redemption was #1 on the top 250 movies of all time, I thought ""Yea, I could understand that"". I don't necessarily agree that it's absolutely the best, but it is so good that it makes sense that a forum of popular consensus for film rankings would rank it at the top.It is the story of Andy Dufresne, played by Tim Robbins and his time at Shawshank Prison. It is a perspective of what it is to be human and to have hope for the future even in the face of insurmountable adversity. It's funny, because I don't really think that any one particular thing stands out as spectacular. The performances are very good, but nothing really noteworthy. The characters all serve the story beautifully, but none of them really stand out from the others. Frank Darabont is great, the shots are exactly what they should be. Almost the entire film is shot at the prison, adding to the feeling of isolation and routine.And yet, we are captivated from the outset. Morgan Freeman could read a Sears catalogue and I'd pay to hear it, his narration breathes life into every scene that it's spoken over. The real beauty of this film is it's story, mostly about Andy and Red (Robbins and Freeman), but it's the way that each character contributes symbiotically to the development of the story that is the absolute mastery. Stephen King's novella ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" was the short story that was used as the basis for the film and it serves as evidence that King is not just a master of horror, but a true literary genius. Sure, he doesn't use as many fifty cent words as histories other great masters, but does anyone tell as good a story? King always gives his writing such distinct atmosphere and energy that you can't help but get swept away. The Shawshank Redemption is no different. If there is a film by which other films should be judged, this is as good as it can get. Powerful, engaging, visceral, despairing, a masterfully woven dialogue of what it means to be human. It's one of those journeys of the human spirit that just makes you feel happy to be alive.An amazing story translated beautifully to the screen. A masterpiece, 10/10.",10,Without a doubt one of the best movies of all time

6 August 2002,tt0111161,ur1787966,True,"I find it very interesting that this movie has ranked so high in this database.  One professional reviewer elsewhere had referred to it as an ""overrated cult film,"" and I can see why.  It is one of those movies that is so unique that it just grabs hold of some people while doing very poorly with the general public at the box office.   But to be ranked as one of the best movies of all time?  I honestly don't see why.Personally, I thought the Stephen King story it was based on was much better.  True to his style, it was a very surrealistic tale about something that couldn't possibly happen in real life.  SPOILER AHEAD!  Come on, it is sheer fantasy to think that someone can dig himself out of prison with a rock pick over the course of many years without someone catching on to what he is doing.  I think that's why the movie is so popular:  it's a feel-good fantasy that pretends to be a prison drama.But it is very entertaining, and keeps you wondering if Andy really did kill his wife.  The ending is too predictable, though.Overall it is a very well-acted and directed movie.  However, the objectionable language and the homosexual rape scenes were totally unnecessary to the plot.  It would have been MUCH better if those aspects of Stephen King's fertile imagination had been left out of the movie.  If not for those parts, I would heartily recommend anyone to see it.",7,An interesting adaptation of a surreal story

I can't see it again and again as it hurts...it's so perfect. When I viewed the movie for the first time, all by myself, it was on a cold winter morning. Who would go and see a movie 9 am on a regular working/week day (college, actually)? But the international film festival was on in my city and it was the last screening of the movie in the festival. So I missed some lectures, rode through the morning fog, and sat long after the projector was switched off in the theater to an incredible movie experience. The press and public had given the Shawshank a standing ovation that day.And I was aching to share it. So saw the movie again, once with my father and once recently with my husband.Just now when I happened to see the Top movies listed on IMDb and that Shawshank is listed at no.2, I was hit by the memory of that cold winter morning.And when I clicked away and read other viewers comments, I noticed how majority of them remember vividly the how, when and where they had seen this film for the first time.

I thought this was one of his more believable roles, before he became a parody of himself. The worst thing about this film is the script, and I feel it thrives in moments of silence. I enjoyed the playing of the record, I thought Brooks hanging himself was excellently done, I thought the rape scene was nasty but not too gruelling.

I have seen quite a few prison drama movies like it. The brilliant performances and well paced story do set it apart from other similar works but still this does not explain how on earth Shawshank Redemption can be classified as one of the all time best cinematic achievements.So I just want to caution anyone who thinks they will see something incredibly unique and magnificent. Without a doubt this art piece is very touching, however I found myself having forgotten about it a couple of hours after I had seen it.

For a movie that is all dialogue and no action, it really delivers. And when I say ""all dialogue and no action"" what I mean to say is, there are no car explosions, car chases, heists or anything you would see in a blockbuster. I'll keep this part as obscure to avoid spoilers but the most action filled part would be when a man is shot in the chest. Or perhaps when there is a police beating. But that's not where the cinematic gold of Shawshank lies. The cinematic gold lies in the character development and the message of hope that it holds within.The Shawshank Redemption shows us that hope can be your best friend and guide you through your tough times. As you can see I rated The Shawshank Redemption 10 out of 10 stars, but I do not believe that is should be #1 on IMDb's Top 250. I believe it should be at least in the Top 20, but not #1. I believe that The Godfather should be #1 but that's a different topic for a different time.My recommendation is to buy this movie. If you rent or borrow it, you'll be disappointed when you have to return. The Shawshank Redemption is a movie you'll want to watch again the minute it is over. I can almost guarantee you will feel inspired when you have finished the movie. I would not call Shawshank a ""triumph of the human spirit"" movie, but it really portrays a hopeful message. In regards to appropriate viewing audiences, I am a bit torn. While this is an inspiring movie, there are a lot of elements that could be considered too taboo for children.

There is only one reason for this: SUPERB ACTING!!! While Tim Robbins appears to be the main characters and leading man, the show is being stolen again and again by Morgan Freeman. But they do complement each other so much that I could not envision this movie without both of them in their respective roles. The rest of the cast, come and go throughout the movies and bring additional drama, emotions and a greater sense of what life could be in prison, either if you are the prisoner or guard. Of course there are parts of the movie that are a bit ""far-fetched"", but you know you are watching a movie, not a real-life drama so it's easily forgiven as it brings deeper enrichment to the movie.SPOILER ALERT: My best scene is when Red (Morgan Freeman) is getting the envelope that Andy (Tim Robbins) left him by the Oak Tree. He scans around to ensure that he is not being watched and he opens the envelope very carefully, while continuing to look around to ensure no one is watching him. What an amazing actor to be able to portrait that sense of distrust of everything, after spending so much time in prison where it becomes a fact of life to always ""look over your shoulder"". I'm always in awe of his acting whenever I come upon this scene. I have seen this movie way back in 1994...and probably at least 10 more times since then...and whenever I flick channels on the TV ( in the odd time I watch ""real"" TV) and see Shawshank Redemption playing...I just can't stop myself to watch it again!",10,"It's a movie that you will watch. and again, and again...."

The other is the one where is so memorable that watching one time will result in you remembering it forever, even if you never ever watch it again. Shawshank Redemption is the latter.The movie itself contains no fast-paced action or fantasy, but the gradual progression of the movie makes way for character growth and realism. In nearly 150 minutes, the viewers find themselves living and growing with Andy and Red, urging for them to make a move and yet never quite certain if they will.I don't really have any words that I can say about this movie other than the fact that it is the type of masterpiece that makes you think hard about everything.",9,"Andy Dufresne, a successful banker, is sentenced to lifetime imprisonment when he is convicted of the murder of his wife and her lover."

And this movie shows how he handles his time in prison, and how he helped his inmates with getting better facilities by giving time and effort to get the funds needed.

20 November 2003,tt0111161,ur2854293,True,"Spoiler!! The philosophical ebbs and flows of The Shawshank Redemption make it the finest movie of the last ten years. Andy is a ping pong ball of hope and despair, of assimilation and rejection.  The same is true of Red, but the philosophical contrast between the two, and the way each is forced to consider the other's viewpoint, is why this movie's message is so poignantly delivered.Andy, in his earliest prison days, is a loner, whose hope that his nightmarish incarceration will not prove real delays his assimilatation into the culture and society of Shawshank.  Ultimately, though, while clinging to an inner belief that Shawshank is not home, he realizes that, in assimilation, lies his only hope of coping with prison life.Contrastingly, Red, a long-term inmate whose once-a-decade parole rejections have become a ritual reminder of the fact that he has no hope of getting out of prison, has assimilated to the fullest possible extent, and clearly views Shawshank as home.Each is frequently exposed to the viewpoint of the other.  Red expresses concern when Andy dreams of life in Mexico, but Andy takes exception when Red proclaims himself to be dependent on Shawshank for his livelihood. Red, in essence, suggests that Andy accept Shawshank as home.Red is selling despair and assimilation to Andy, but Andy is selling hope and rejection to Red.  When Andy escapes from Shawshank, Red's chance to sell Shawshank to Andy evaporates, but it's impossible to tell whether Andy has reached Red or not, and it appears that it doesn't really matter.The brilliant twist toward the end of The Shawshank Redemption is that it is the manifestation of his despair to the parole board that results in Red's parole.  Even in parole, however, Red finds despair in assimilation, the same despair that prompted Brooks to commit suicide some years earlier. Only when he reads the note Andy left for him in the hayfields of Buxton is Red presented with a chance to pursue a course of hope and rejection.Rejection, in this case, means parole violation, and results directly from Red's, seemingly unprecedented, hope for a happy life.  When Red acts on his impulse and travels to Mexico to, presumably, live out his life alongside the greatest friend he has ever known, he, finally, buys into Andy's philosophies about hope, despair, assimilation and rejection.
In doing so, he provides a happy ending to a film that may live on forever due to the criticality of its subject matter and its masteful delivery of its message.",10,"Hope, Despair, Assimilation and Rejection"

Darabont's adaptation of a Stephen King novella is a throwback to the kind of serious, literate drama Hollywood used to make (Birdman of Alcatraz, say) though the big spiritual resolution takes some swallowing - ditto the colour-blind relationships within the prison and the violent disavowal of any homosexual implications. Against this weighs the pleasure of discovering a first-time director with evident respect for the intelligence of his audience, brave enough to let character details accumulate without recourse to the fast- forward button.

Starting off, it is almost a sure thing that no prison movie could ever be in that category for me.  The closest would be ""Papillon"", which is clearly better than this, and other movies are better at capturing general mistreatments of prisoners even as they focus on certain main characters.  Here, altho there were other instances of abuse, the emphasis is on the main character in his role in the story, not the society of prison inmates.  Not that I am a particular lover of the total depressing side, but to communicate negative qualities of a prison, the bad stuff needs to be presented more--the violence more graphic, the negative conditions more thoughtfully.  I know people cite the story as well, but I think if this movie is to be on such a high pedestal there should be something more special about the portrayal of life in prison, and there isn't.I thought the acting performances of Tim Robbins (who plays chief character Andrew Dufresne) and Morgan Freeman were, similarly, quite good but not great, and although I was into the story, it just did not bring tears to my eyes.  I don't think the ""twists"" were all that unique--I guess I've been jaded by the modern (80s onward) murder dramas.

Red procures a rock hammer for Andy, allowing him to create small stone chess pieces. Red later gets him a large poster of Rita Hayworth, followed in later years by images of Marilyn Monroe and Raquel Welch. Andy works in the prison laundry, but is regularly assaulted by the ""bull queer"" gang ""the Sisters"" and their leader Bogs (Mark Rolston).In 1949, Andy overhears the brutal chief guard Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown) complaining about taxes on a forthcoming inheritance and informs him about a financial loophole. After another vicious assault by the Sisters nearly kills Andy, Hadley severely beats Bogs resulting in Bogs being sent to another prison. Andy is not attacked again. Warden Samuel Norton (Bob Gunton) meets with Andy and reassigns him to the prison library to assist elderly inmate Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), a pretext for Andy to manage financial duties for the prison. His advice and expertise are soon sought by other guards at Shawshank and from nearby prisons. Andy begins writing weekly letters to the state government for funds to improve the decrepit library.In 1954, Brooks is freed on parole, but unable to adjust to the outside world after 50 years in prison, he hangs himself. Andy receives a library donation that includes a recording of The Marriage of Figaro. He plays an excerpt over the public address system, resulting in his receiving solitary confinement. After his release, Andy explains that he holds onto hope as something that the prison cannot take from him, but Red dismisses the idea.

Andy approaches Norton with this information, but the warden refuses to listen. Norton places Andy in solitary confinement and has Hadley murder Tommy, under the guise of an escape attempt. Andy refuses to continue with the scam, but Norton threatens to destroy the library and take away his protection and preferential treatment. After Andy is released from solitary confinement, he tells Red of his dream of living in Zihuatanejo, a Mexican Pacific coastal town. While Red shrugs it off as being unrealistic, Andy instructs him, should he ever be freed, to visit a specific hayfield near Buxton to retrieve a package.The next day at roll call, upon finding Andy's cell empty, an irate Norton throws one of Andy's rocks at the poster of Raquel Welch hanging on the wall. The rock tears through the poster, revealing a tunnel that Andy had dug with his rock hammer over the previous two decades. The previous night, Andy escaped through the tunnel and the prison's sewage pipe with Norton's ledger, containing details of the money laundering. While guards search for him the following morning, Andy, posing as Randall Stephens, visits several banks to withdraw the laundered money. Finally, he sends the ledger and evidence of the corruption and murders at Shawshank to a local newspaper.

Red is our surrogate. He's the one we identify with, and the redemption, when it comes, is Red's. We've been shown by Andy's example that you have to keep true to yourself, not lose hope, bide your time, set a quiet example and look for your chance. ""I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really,"" he tells Red. ""Get busy livin' or get busy dyin'.""",10,"Hope is a good thing, maybe the best of things. And no good thing ever dies."

It uses the narrator's calm, observant voice to include us in the story of men who have formed a community behind bars. It is deeper than most films; about continuity in a lifetime, based on friendship and hope.Interesting that although the hero of the film is the convicted former banker Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), the action is never seen from his point of view. The film's opening scene shows him being given two life sentences for the murder of his wife and her lover, and then we move, permanently, to a point of view representing the prison population and particularly the lifer Ellis 'Red' Redding (Morgan Freeman).

6 January 2013,tt0111161,ur17029428,True,"A prison escape that is technically so much better than other prison escape stories.A man wanted freedom, he redeems his life by escaping for the Shawshank prison and the man's name is Andy Dufrsne. This film is dramatic take of a man, and in a way it is similar to Escape from Alcatraz and The Great Escape. The similarity is that the above mentioned films are also prison escapes and the similarity ends there. This movie is more about hope and redemption than anything else and this is what sets this film above the other escape stories. For a man, freedom is highest value and he would do anything to get it. Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is such a nice fellow that we would for sure like him for the way he is, when he chuckles at the warden when music is played in prison or when he asks for beers to his friends without having a sip. We like him because he is selfless, humane in nature. But more so, he is selfish and works towards his freedom at the same time. Now, in terms of character he has company n the firm of Red (Morgan Freeman) and what a great character, RED was, is understood, by the way he narrates the story. And thus, it's not surprising for Morgan Freeman to have garnered more best actor award nominations than Tim Robbins. The novel, written by Stephen sets it up in 1949 - 1966 period in a prison called Shawshank in Maine, USA. Frank Darabont made it into a film that's great to see but also tests our patience. It's great in terms of cinematography, lighting and costume design and even art direction, but greater was the acting by two lead characters. Just because of their acting, I was compelled to see this story of HOPE, that ends in a good way.The sound design is great and worthy of a special mention as a realistic sound the prison of 1940's to 60's was created. Editing though, I believe could have been done by cutting short a few scenes, or rather cutting out a few scenes, just like say one week of hole for Bogs. I have seen this thrice and, since I knew that this is the best rated picture on IMDb, but the more I see it, the less I started to like it, may be I know the story too very well. Maybe, I am finding fault with reasons of a prison escape done too trivially, by crawling in gutter for 500 yards or by creating a hole in the room. Or maybe, I think that Andy was just too easy and too casual on what he did. These are all my own reasons that put me down each time, I see this. Yet this has a good place in my memory and heart for I see this, just because there is hope, and HOPE IS A GOOD THING. I just love the dialogs of this film and thanks to Stephen King and Frank Darabont for that.It's a 4/5 for a movie that may not be the best in my view yet is a good one to be watching.

13 March 2009,tt0111161,ur2955724,False,"The story of this film takes place over a twenty-year period between 1947 and 1967. Andy Dufresne, a young banker from Portland, Maine, is wrongly convicted of murdering his wife and her lover, and sentenced to life imprisonment. (""Shawshank"" is the name of the prison where he serves his sentence). The prison is a brutal place, and Andy is frequently beaten and sexually assaulted by a gang of homosexual inmates called ""The Sisters"". Two things, however, help him to survive. One is his friendship with another convict, Red, who has a reputation for being able to acquire almost any item and, for a price, to smuggle it into the prison. The other is his financial expertise, which he puts to good use, becoming a tax and financial adviser to the prison guards and even the Warden himself. As a reward for these services, Andy is given a privileged job in the prison library and protection from molestation. To avenge their attacks on Andy, the leader of the ""Sisters"" is so badly beaten by the guards that he is crippled for life; Andy is not molested again.The Warden devises a scheme under which inmates are put to work on local construction projects. The purpose of this is ostensibly to prepare them for life after they are released, but in reality he is exploiting their free labour for his own personal profit, and using Andy's financial skills to launder the proceeds. This arrangement seems to work to Andy's advantage, because of the extra privileges he is granted, but things change when a new young prisoner named Tommy Williams is sent to Shawshank. Tommy has evidence that could secure Andy's release; a former cellmate in another prison has confessed to him that he committed the murders for which Andy was convicted. Tommy confides this secret to the Warden who, fearing that his illegal schemes will be revealed should Andy ever be released, arranges to have Tommy murdered by a corrupt guard.There is a long history of American prison films, including the likes of ""I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"", ""Cool Hand Luke"", ""Brubaker"" and the more recent ""The Last Castle"". (Frank Darabont was later to direct another prison film, ""The Green Mile"", based, like ""The Shawshank Redemption"" on a Stephen King story). Most of these were made with a liberal social agenda in mind, aiming to expose the harsh prison conditions and thereby inspire their reform. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" falls, to some extent, within this tradition; it is made from a basically liberal viewpoint and vividly depicts the brutality of prison life, although the fact that it is a period piece, set several decades in the past, might suggest that social issues were not the filmmakers' sole concern. Perhaps more important are the analysis of the nature of freedom and of the relationship between Andy and Red.The word ""prison"", from the French ""pris"" (""taken""), merely indicates a place where captives are held, and the authorities, especially in America, prefer to describe many prisons by some more positive term such as ""penitentiary"" or ""reformatory"" which implies their purpose of rehabilitating criminals. Shawshank, a prison where the Warden and guards are at least as crooked as the inmates, has precisely the opposite effect. Andy goes in innocent of any crime and comes out guilty of being an accessory to corruption and fraud. Yet, despite his involvement in the Warden's dishonesty, Andy retains a certain integrity; he refuses to give up hope and refuses to allow himself to be beaten by the system. Although he is in prison he has found a sort of freedom. A key moment comes when he defies the guards to play a Mozart aria over the prison loudspeakers for all the inmates to hear- a reminder of spiritual values even in the harshest of environments.Red faces a different problem. He fears that he has become so institutionalised that he will be unable to survive freedom, as happened to another long-term prisoner who committed suicide shortly after his release. In prison, his role as the ""fixer"" who can obtain anything, be it a packet of cigarettes, a rock hammer or a poster of Rita Hayworth, makes him the king of the inmates. (These latter two items will play an important role in the plot). On the outside he will be just another ex-con trying to make ends meet in a dead-end job. Paradoxically, he is more free in jail than he will be on the outside. I won't give away the ending, but it involves Andy repaying Red's previous kindnesses by showing him how he can be free in all senses of the word.The film was not a great box office success when first released but has since acquired a status as one of the classics of the modern American cinema; it has now supplanted ""The Godfather"" as number one on IMDb's Top 250 list. The film would perhaps not be number one on my personal list, but it is a fine one and would certainly be in my top 250, perhaps the top 100. Its two stars, Tim Robbins as Andy and Morgan Freeman as Red, are both excellent. Its initial lack of success may have had something to do with its rather clumsy title. ""Shawshank"" is not a word that will mean anything to the average person (according to one story Darabont was once asked how his ""rickshaw"" film was going) and ""redemption"", except in technical legal contexts, normally has a religious connotation. This is not an explicitly religious film; indeed, in its portrayal of Warden Norton as a sanctimonious, Bible-bashing hypocrite, it can be seen as critical of religion. Nevertheless, the word ""redemption"" is perhaps appropriate in this context, after undergoing the hell of Shawshank Andy and Red manage to find a sort of secular redemption. It may be this message of hope that accounts for the film's continuing popularity. 9/10",9,A Sort of Secular Redemption

The things that happen in that prison would never happen, just because some nerdy bank manager has ""hope..."" Give me a break! Which soap opera did that sad line come from! No wonder it was initially ignored, and it should be continued to be ignored. Robbins, who is accused and wrongly convicted for the murders of his wife and her lover, never ages. At one point he HAS TO ""remind"" us he's been in jail for 12 years, because it only looks like a week.Yet did you see the way he really changed in 12 years from 1994 to 2006. He looks a much older man. And of course he does, he's 12 years older!! In the Shamshank Dedeption he never aged one day in 12 years, and his hair is even cut the same style.Even when we then go forward something like 20 years, he still looks the same, never aged at all, apart from a few bluey grey hairs at the sides. And after he escapes (after 20 years of tunnelling through thick concrete with a a small screwdriver), he meets up with his old buddy Freeman, who got out of jail legally. And get this, BOTH look younger than when they first went in.By my reckoning Tim Robbins should now be about 70, and Morgan Freeman in his early 80s, yet both after serving their time still look barely 40.And what a load of talkative rubbish.

The movie tells the story of Andy Dufresne, portrayed brilliantly by Tim Robbins, who is sent to Shawshank prison, when framed as the murderer of his wife, and her affair lover. During his time in prison, Andy makes an unlikely friendship with smoke dealer ""Red"", portrayed by the astounding Morgan Freeman, who does an excellent job of guiding the movie with his smoothing, and confident narration. Now, the rest of the movie talks about Andy's struggle to try and break free from Shawshank, and the unexpected friendship between two different people. This movie is an astounding masterpiece, that can only be spoken through the words of the mysteriously defying Stephen King. Director Frank Darabont helped bring King's vision to life on the screen, and he performed an excellent job as a director, and a writer. Also, the cast is such a true miracle, that the movie was able to get the finest actors to play the most finest cinematic roles. Tim Robbins is excellent, Morgan Freeman is astounding, Bob Gunton is brilliant, and James Whitmore plays such a dramatic small role as ""Brooks"", the Shawshank librarian. Also, I enjoyed Thomas Newman's breathtaking score, the perfect cinematography, the excellent use of film editing, and the spectacular script. I respected every single moment in this movie, and it had me wanting for more.

29 June 2005,tt0111161,ur0892646,False,"Now this is why we go to movies. I'm surprised at how this film flopped when it was first released in 1994 and yet 11 years later, it's considered one of the greatest movies of all time. I think it's the greatest movie of all time (sorry, to all of those who think that title goes to ""The Godfather""). Yet, here is a movie that in all instances should have failed. Maybe it was because of the plot, which shared too many likenesses to every cliché prison drama we've ever seen. But I assure you, that's not what goes on here. Directed by Frank Darabont, who wrote the film's script, which is an adaptation of the Stephen King short story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption,"" ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is filled with a strong sense of self-worth and purpose. Yes, in the beginning a man named Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) is convicted for a murder he did not commit. Behind the walls of Shawshank penitentiary, Andy finds himself the victim (a ""fish"" - prison slang for a new arrival) of violent acts by other hardcore convicts. He begins a tentative friendship with a fellow lifer, Red (Morgan Freeman, in an Oscar-nominated role), and Andy finds himself doing the taxes of the warden (Bob Gunton). In all of this, we know that a man, like Andy, is not meant to be locked up, whether he committed a heinous crime or not because simply, the human spirit is not meant to kept down by mortal circumstances. This lends a great amount of weight and structure to the film's most powerful image, which has ingrained itself indelibly into our minds. This movie carefully avoids clichés, and it's the better for it. Tim Robbins is a revelation in this movie, as is Morgan Freeman and the rest of the supporting players. ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is a film about hope in even the most bleak of places, which could be considered prison. It's a movie that has rightfully earned a place in cinematic history as a legend and a masterpiece of film. It's no wonder why.10/10",10,"""The Shawshank Redemption"""

Firstly, I agree that the absence of special effects is a boon in any 1990s film. Secondly, Freeman and Robbins act well and are well-directed. The storyline, though, lacks subtlety (not in the telling - this is a very well directed film - but as a story) and Dufesne comes over as a kind of everything-he-touches, incarcerated upper-middle class Forrest Gump. The film is suffused with a kind of Manichean morality which tips over too readily into sentimentality (again, despite the best efforts of Freeman and Robbins) and which, ultimately, I found cloying.Perhaps, though, I'm being too harsh.

8 July 2007,tt0111161,ur3227375,True,"This is in my opinion, tied with Goodfellas for the greatest ever made. Masterfully conceived and directed by Frank Darabont, a powerfully adapted story from Stephen King's short story, amazing acting, and one of the best musical scores ever written made this movie one of the handful of masterpieces that will never die. Along with Goodfellas losing Best Picture, choosing Forest Gump(a great movie) over the Shawshank Redemption was the biggest mistake they ever made. The movie that makes many references to redemption and hope is like Jesus himself. The film did poorly in the box office but has enjoyed one of the greatest afterlives in the history of cinema.Plot: The story is taken from Stephen King's short story ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption"" and Frank Darabont made one of the only movies better than the source material. Masterfully crafted to start with a depressing image of everything the film goes to make one of the most uplifting, happy, and powerful endings in the history of film.Acting: Narrating is Morgan Freeman who gives an Oscar-Worthy performance as Red a lifer for murder in The Shawshank State Prison. Tim Robbins likewise gives a powerful performance as the sympathetic Andy Dufresne a lifer for murder as well. Playing the cold and ruthless Mr. Norton the Warden is Bob Gunton who creates one of the greatest villains I've ever seen on screen.Quality: This film is one of the greatest ever. One of the things that really made this film was probably one of the best, most uplifting and powerful musical scores I've ever heard which also deserved an Oscar. The camera work was also fantastic opening with a sky-view of the prison.This is one of the few movies where if you don't see the genius of it I will have to question if you really seen the entire film or any of the film. This is along with Goodfellas the greatest movies ever. There are only a handful of masterpieces in history and this is one of them.

25 March 2011,tt0111161,ur23896566,False,"Every time I watch The Shawshank Redemption it reinforces the fact that it is my favorite movie of all time. But certainly as entertaining a film that it is, being a personal favorite does not necessarily make it a great film or dare I saythe greatest film ever made. But what then makes a film great? First and foremost, if it sets out to entertain the general public, it must do that (and Shawshank certainly does that). Its pure entertainment value is essentially a stipulation in its inclusion in the great ""greatest movie"" debate. The serious nature of its central plot pointsa wrongly convicted murderer who assists the corrupt warden as means to affect his own escapeis contrasted by some truly funny scenes. Although by no means a comedy, the splendid screenplay is wrought with witty dialog. There's nothing fancy about this filmno special effects, spectacular scenery or even a bunch of pretty women. No, its just the telling of a story, mostly through the narration of Morgan Freeman's character, Red, that almost lulls viewers into believing that nothing really interesting or important is going to happen here. But after all of the subtle plot twists I think what makes this film great for me is I feel like I'm actually sharing in Andy's redemption. Now if that isn't what they teach in Film-making 101 then they should just close up the classroom. Ultimately, there cannot be a single motion picture that is the ""greatest film of all time"" because as art, and in an art form as varied as cinema, greatness must be measured by each individual. Greatness, as beauty, truly is in the eye of the beholder. But in this beholder's eyes I think The Shawshank Redemption is truly the greatest film I have ever seen.",10,What a movie !!

29 October 2000,tt0111161,ur0801129,False,"I actually watched last year's 'The Green Mile' before I got round to seeing this.  And in many respects I'm glad.  This film is better constructed, has a far more powerful script, and, most tellingly, a far more belivable story (the Green Mile dabbles in the supernatural and improbable).  What makes this movie so good is that it really deals with the psyche and emotions of humanity, and isn't scared to go into detail with these emotions, even if it means that the plot is sidetracked for a few minutes.  The male bonding throughout the film is touching, and (although sentimental) completely believable.  The twist, although not quite as surprising as the 'Usual Suspects', adds a little bit extra to a plot that before was pretty much at the mercy of Morgan Freeman's narrative, which, while well delivered, all gets a bit similar after a while. I think the biggest achievement here is, apart from the bread and butter stuff like 'solid acting', 'sensitive direction', and 'breathtaking photography', is just how well the movie shows its time scale.  The story is based over 20 years, charting the 'prison career' of an innocent man, and apart from the greying of Freeman's hair, it also features a lot of nostalgic conversations.  Two tragedies among the group of friends that we watch also give a sense of perspective.  At the centre though, are Freeman's brief meetings with the prison board, asking for a release every ten years. As he delivers the most moving part of the film- his third speech to this board, I guarantee you will be weeping buckets.  The first movie I ever watched that meant so well as to be 'beyond criticism' was 'Schindler's List'. This is the second.",8,There is not a single human emotion that this film does not bring out.

Morgan has a voice and a way of telling a story that pulls you right into it. He does the same in the more recent film March Of The Penguins, which is also another good film.Another good thing about Shawshank is that when you come to the ""stunning"" ending they don't just drop you right there, they still spend a good 15 - 20 minutes developing the end of the story.

I remained a little apprehensive; was this film as great as the masses of IMDb and particularly world wide were saying? From the moment I began watching this film to the very end, I was kept completely in awe at how beautiful and amazing this film is.The Shawshank Redemption is a film set in a US Prison, following the story of Andy Dufrense who was sent to Shawshank for a crime in which he did not forget. Here, he meets Ellis ""Red"" Redding (played by Morgan Freeman) an aged convict who, unlike the majority of the populace, accepts that he is a guilty man. The two develop a friendship over the lasting years, which evolves into what could be akin to brotherhood.The message of hope in this film is as inspirational as it is an interesting concept. Despite being convicted, Andy undertakes a quest to become a free man once more, even if it means breaking the laws and, as shown later in the film, breaking out of ShawshankThe acting in this film is simply outstanding. Morgan Freeman, providing both a character and the narration of said character, portrays his character in such a convincing way that one can't help but feel moved by his dialogue. Bob Gunton, who plays Warden Norton (an immensely corrupt individual), passes himself off in such a brilliant performance that I couldn't help but feel pure anger for the Warden throughout the movie.But perhaps what makes this movie so beautiful is the underlying messages. Despite being incarcerated for life without parole, Andy maintains hope, despite what the others say when he freely speaks of it. The evolving friendship of Red and himself delivers the message that not all criminals are rabid beasts, and that friendship can outlast the grim depression of a prison. Though I am by no means proud to admit it, I felt myself become watery-eyed several times throughout the film, particularly the letter sent by Brooks before he commits suicide, climaxing in a tragic, heart-breaking scene.Wherever you are in the world, you must see this movie.

Some viewers are looking for gritty realism in everything on the screen.  Others are action junkies.  Still others perhaps take film too seriously and reduce moviemaking to nothing more than a game of who can come up with the edgiest shot, or the niftiest angle.  For all of these, there is the very real chance that they simply will not ""get"" this film, and that's too bad -- they are missing out on a classic.At its best, film can transcend merely being a series of pictures, no matter how pretty, and can reach down and touch people.  That is where Shawshank succeeds so brilliantly.  It is not the fastest moving movie, not the edgiest, not the grittiest, it is filmed in shades of gray.

I mean, this legend, is in some of the best films ever made like Shawshank Redemption, Se7en and the Dark Knight. Morgan Freeman is simply unbelievable in this film and the relationship between his character, Red and Andy was just superbly filmed. It actually gave me tears****SPOILERS****When Brooks was finally released from Shawshank, he realises the outside world is too much for him and commits suicide. This scene was just so sad it left me crying. The same when Red was released, I again started crying. The scene were Norton kills himself was totally surprising and a shock to me, realizing that Andy had truly defeated him and there was nothing for him to live for.The ending scene where Red and Andy reunite after all those days, or years, was just breathtaking and I was glad the film ended the way it did.

This is the story of a falsely convicted man, and his struggle for freedom.  Beyond the already great fact that it was a prison movie set in the 40's through late 60's, it was written by Stephen King, one of the greatest fictional writers of the late 20th centruy.  The best part about prison movies is the fact that it's always moving, always developing, never boring.  There's just something about prison movies that make you feel at home, as odd as that sounds.  And plus, the movie was full of great narration and dialouge, full prison similes that were so eloquent, you know only Stephen King could have written them.

After finally found this movie and saw it by myself, I can say that the rating shows everything: this is one of a top movie you should watch before you die. No matter that Shawshank was defeated in all its nominations of Academy Award 1994: number of award is not always a correct guideline to tell you whether a movie is good or not.The theme is just simple, if we compare with 2000s movies: mainly talks about friendship and hope. In this almost-100-percent-male-actors film, there is no special sound effect, science-fiction complicated visual effect, super make-up on actors/actresses, just the story and dialogs. But the theme is so unique, can say this is a signature film about prison; and the message it brings will stay forever after you finished watching, so that you'll never forget. That's why I gave a 10: I was really surprised/shocked about this movie's ending, and even tried to watch it again about 2-3 times!Still re-think to watch this movie?

14 August 2011,tt0111161,ur8049825,False,"Wow, been a few years. I'm editing my old post. I'd like to humbly thank everyone here for rating my flick so highly. #1, huh? Providing the story for Shawshank Redemption was an imagination of myself under the short story's circumstances. It is similar to K-PAX that way and of the same vintage. Having been a business major at Georgia Tech, it would be natural for me to help with estate planning, taxes, and accounting had I been taken prisoner. The inside out program of public works and attendant graft, corruption, intimidation and murder was my way of encouraging scrutiny of similar programs nation-wide. I had been Postmaster of the Georgia State Senate at 21, so that is why the State Senate was written instead of the more common oracles, say the Maine Governor's office or other organs of government and foundations. The Mozart duet wasn't of my choosing, but it's generally acknowledged as among the most beautiful pieces of music ever written, so that choice was a no-brainer. I would have preferred the flute solo from Orpheus, but that's just me. I purposefully decided against another loathsome portrayal of racial casts that were very common at that time, so as not to 'date' the picture and to influence viewers toward tolerance even in intolerable circumstances. Against opposition, I gave the important Red character to an African-American actor. (In the short story Red had been an Irishman.) At the time, that dimmed prospects for box office success, but given that the flick is now well- received, emulation has led to further improvement. When we did this one in 1988ish, in Syracuse, New York, I was attending graduate school of medicine at SUNY-upstate and working in Max Mozell's lab. At about the same time, I did dozens of films and won many Oscars for the various ghost writers. (Gladiator, Good Will Hunting, Cast Away, Mystic River, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Enemy at the Gates, Green Mile, Shawshank Redemption, Vanilla Sky, A Beautiful Mind, Forrest Gump, The Matrix films, The Bourne films, National Treasure films, Pirates of the Caribbean films, Avatar, Titanic, Lost in Translation, UP, ). The name of the Mexican town on the seashore was conveyed to me by my old friend, Frank Arnold, who was Zawataneo (sp?) on vacation while in medical school. He spelled it for me over the phone while the 'creative team' and I worked out the flick's details. Since then, the town has boomed, an unexpected gift to Mexico. I set this one in Maine, to de-stigmatize inflexible regional prejudices then current. It seems to have worked. Michael Meyers figured me out, this flick is part of the series designed to change the world, save the planet, and bring the human race closer to God Almighty.",10,Thanks for everyone's high rating.

These are movies which appear like Comets once in a Cinema lifetime, instead of doom and gloom; they uplift our sullen mood. I have never been a fan of Fiction since there is enough drama in real life.However I am an ardent fan of narrated Movies, which takes me to Scorsese and his catalog of Celluloid Classics.There was some great narrative styles in ""Good Fellas"" and ""Casino"", but Morgan Freeman takes narration to a newlevel. His Barry White tinged voice is one of the glues that hold this tale of a convict who has more convictions in his soul than the alleged convictions. Morgan Freeman is the finest actor in his genre. Tim Robbins as ""Andy"" is one of the best performances by an actor, that I have seen lately. some of the common threads to a good movie that I have noticed is the Scriptwriter who also wields the megaphone, since this gives a edge over a director who is trying to put a face on the story. Frank Darabont has done a splendid job so much so we feel that these two Characters are alive and working on their boat in sunny Mexico. The dual talent of writing and directing is evident in the success of great Directors like Coppola, (God Father, with Mario Puzo) Scorsese.(Good Fellas, with Nicholas Pillegi).

These themes, which concern things the human spirit undoubtedly yearns for, seem so intricately woven into the plot that it easily draws its audience in to its story. Though full of hardened criminals, your heart will go out to these men as they display the most basic of human emotions, and deliver some of the most quotable lines in a film to date.

7 September 2007,tt0111161,ur4948347,False,"The Shawshank Redemption is based on a story by Stephen King, but if you know what King usually writes about, you will be totally surprised by this film. There are no monsters or creepy crawlies at all. No, instead we are given a story about prison life that involves our two central characters, Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) and Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), both of whom are convicted of multiple life sentences in Shawshank Prison.Andy is a banker whose life is turned upside down when he is convicted of murdering both his wife and her lover. Sentenced to 2 life prisons, Andy does his best to survive by using his skills as a banker and accountant to move up in the prison world. He soon gains respect from his fellow inmates, especially Red, and not long after both he and Red become good friends. I was never sure what Red was imprisoned for, and though the story is mainly about Andy, Red's role is just as important. Kudos to Morgan Freeman, who gives one of his best performances ever.The movie is well over two hours long, but I was never bored. Frank Darabont, the director and writer of the screenplay, keeps things interesting throughout. The pacing is perfect, and the actors, all of them, kept me engaged in the story. The movie also has some twists and turns which when finally revealed are perfect and add to the film's excitement.The dialog is one of the most important aspects of the film and one of the films strongest points. We may have never learned much about the prison guards or the warden, but we got enough of an idea about them to be satisfied because of the dialog and because of the actors who played those parts. Also dialog is vital in Andy and Red's friendship. Without it, and the great work by the two actors, the film wouldn't have been quite as strong.The only flaw I could find in the story would be in the prison terms for both men. If they are both imprisoned for multiple life sentences, how come they never seem to age over the years? It is a small problem, but it takes away some of the reality of the movie, and so I can't quite give it the perfect rating. Other than that, this is still and incredible movie going experience.Note: I see that Shawshank Redemption is sitting pretty at #2 on IMDb's top 250. I'm not sure it deserves to be that high, but that doesn't stop it from still being superior to many other films on that list.",9,Not your usual Stephen King story

Andy's wife (Renee Blaine) is a beautiful and slim brunette who finally breaks her silence about her love affair with Glenn Quentin (Scott Mann) a golf pro. She informs Andy that she wants a divorce in Reno which he denied her. Now Andy finds himself facing a judge and jury as he flashes back to a dark and drunken night sitting in a wooden area at the end of a driveway in his car with a trusty bottle of Rosewood liquor in one hand, a musical tone ""If I didn't care"" (Jack Lawrence) playing in the background as a reaches for his six shooter from the glove compartment. Andy's blank face tells his version of his innocence; however, the neighbors plus two dead bodies tell the other side of the story. The dead body of Andy's wife and the golf pro give him two life sentences in the big houseShawshank Prison! Andy arrives at Shawshank with the same blank facial expression that granted him the bus ride to the prison. As the welcoming committee provided a grand opening to the bus load of ""Fresh Fish"" inmates. This single file march of leg irons clanking, feet shuffling across the dusty prison yard, as fresh fish pass by the thunderous claps, and yelling voices which intimated some of the new fish. Ellis Boyd ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman) placed a bet of 10 cigarettes on the new fish named Andy Dufresne. Andy has a naive way of thinking, along with his new normal routine of strolling the prison yard in search of smooth rocks while keeping to himself. Andy finally breaks his silence after a month and engages in a conversation with Red. Andy's life sentence was almost cut short while eavesdropping on a conversation of the brutal Captain Hadley (Clancy Brown). Since Andy befriends Red and his crew of intimates Brooks Hatlen (James Whitmore), Heywood (William Sadler), Jigger (Neil Giuntoli), Floyd (Brian Libby), and Skeet (Larry Brandenburg), he placed a request for a bottle of suds after the rigged roof job is completed by this team of inmates. Andy was able to do his ""Real Job"" again by performing banking services for every prison guard in Shawshank. Although he longed for this new freedom Andy still has to fight off his predator Boggs Diamond (Mark Rolston). Andy is on the verge of losing his freedom due to his overzealous attitude toward Warden Norton (Bob Gunton). The Warden provides Andy with a few options while he spends two months in solitary confinement to reset his mind and his mouth. This melodramatic crime film will have your emotions racing as you cook up a new avenue for Andy to travel down. The actors in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" have a more boisterous tone compared to the relaxed spoken actors in ""The Green Mile"" John Coffey (Michael Clark Duncan), Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), Brutus ""Brutal"" Howell (David Morse), ""Wild Bill"" Wharton (Sam Rockwell), Eduard Delacroix (Michael Jeter), and Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper). The lighting for these two melodramatic crime films are different. Both John Coffey and Andy Dufresne are in prison for murder. Andy has more of a dark shadow over his face at times probably due to depression and when harm is coming his way. The lighting changes for him when he is able to accomplish a ""normal / human"" side of his past. John Coffey has a brighter atmosphere when is able to arouse those around him to think outside the box and have a more positive attitude in their heart toward life. John and Andy have to figure out which way to go in order to have freedom while in prison.",9,Human again!

This movie has my utmost respect.This is truly a great film, even with all my negative baggage, and seeing clips, and reading people raving about it, I still avoided it.To render a grown man to cry even with all the baggage, has to be a really amazing film.This film transcends cinema, to what it's truly about - to move you. So technically, it's pointless, you can go about actors, direction, shots, music and so on, and to analyse this film purely on that level would be one very stupid mistake. A mistake many have used while writing reviews.The book or film, is simply a mechanism to get a message across, it can be flawed and still work perfectly. That's not the point.The message here is clear and works perfectly, on many unconscious levels, it really would be stupid to try an figure it out.You can't as its so simple.We all have hope dreams and desires, and want freedom and a better future. Every person does. It's actually why we exist.Not to have hope, dreams and desires and goals, is truly not to live. Not doing so, there is no meaning to life.No matter what happens, keep positive, have hopes dreams and desires, that is your purpose here on this planet this is what this film is about, everything else is just mechanics to get this across?Are you Positive?Do you have hopes?Do you have dreams?Do you have goals?Have you helped your fellow man, just for the beauty and pleasure of making someone happy, in a totally unselfish way, without any personal gain?If you haven't and don't have hopes, dreams, desires and goals, you are not alive, you have no meaning to your life.In conclusion, you can avoid this film as long as you want like I did, but when it does catch up with you... you better be ready, very ready.If you aren't or don't understand what you are watching, and what really is going on between the lines and mechanics of the imperfect mechanism of cinema you are dead, truly dead, and you might as well end it now.So my advise to you?Don't Watch this film. If you've read this far, and not got what I've been going on about you are a lost cause already, and you might as well go into your miserable life, and causing misery to yourself and others.

He's sentenced to a life term at the Shawshank State Prison in Maine, where another lifer, Ellis ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Freeman), picks him as the new recruit most likely to crack under the pressure. The ugly realities of prison life are quickly introduced to Andy: a corrupt warden (Bob Gunton), sadistic guards led by Capt. Byron Hadley (Clancy Brown), and inmates who are little better than animals, willing to use rape or beatings to insure their dominance. But Andy does not crack: he has the hope of the truly innocent, which (together with his smarts) allow him to prevail behind bars. He uses his banking skills to win favor with the warden and the guards, doing the books for Norton's illegal business schemes and keeping an eye on the investments of most of the prison staff.

6 May 2001,tt0111161,ur0476267,False,"This is a story about the despair of life in prison, as well as the friendship and hope that can be found and maintained within its walls, against all odds.As mentioned above, and as far as I am concerned, this movie is the best of all time.  I have lost count of the number of times I have seen this movie, and it touches me every time I watch it.  As a matter of fact, I just finished watching this movie on television, on a cable channel that cannot seem to get enough of showing this film.  I'm sure you know the one I mean, because they have shown this movie dozens of times, usually back to back. If you are a fan of this film, I'm sure you watch it every time it is on, much like I do, and are always amazed, yet again, at the end of it.This film is written so eloquently that I doubt much could top it.  Having not read the original short story by Stephen King (which is titled ""Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption""), I cannot comment on the accuracy of the movie in relation to his telling of story.  However, I'm sure that it does justice to King's writing.  Frank Darabont, who wrote the screenplay and directed Shawshank, also wrote the screenplay for and directed King's other prison film, The Green Mile, which also should not be missed.The acting here is excellent, but I doubt anybody would be surprised at that, given the cast present here.  Morgan Freeman (Se7en, Deep Impact, Kiss The Girls) has shown time and time again that he is one of Hollywood's best and most underrated actors, and he certainly shines here as Red, the man who ""knows how to get things.""  Freeman's narration is superb, I doubt a better job could have been done by anyone else.  In the history of film, people such as James Earl Jones and Martin Sheen never fail to provide narration that is highly eloquent, but this film shows that Freeman deserves to be in the same category as those two actors.  Tim Robbins does a great job as Andy Dufresne, an innocent man who knows he will remain in prison for a long time to come, but refuses to give up hope.Despite excellent writing and acting, however, I believe the most poignant thing about this film is the score.  Present at the best times, and lacking when it should be, the use of the score for this film helps set the tone and the mood for almost every scene.  Obviously, in a film set in a prison, there isn't much happiness to go around.  However, certain scenes in this film are defined by the score that goes with them, making the viewer look twice at a scene which would otherwise be quite drab and seemingly unimportant, and making them appear different than they are, thus impressing the theme of hope on the viewer in an almost subconscious fashion.Historically, of course, this film will never be viewed with the respect and honor it deserves, especially with newer, more appealing prison-based films available, such as the aforementioned The Green Mile.  It is unfortunate that Shawshank didn't win the Academy Awards it was nominated for, because it certainly deserved them.  However, during its Oscar year, it was up against a little Tom Hanks vehicle called Forrest Gump, a movie which held back most others that year, and deservedly so.  As often happens, seemingly to avoid one particular film taking home all the gold, Oscars were awarded to other films over Forrest Gump that year in various categories, and it's too bad that Shawshank wasn't one of them.I guarantee that you will love the characters of Andy & Red, along with the interaction between them; hate Warden Norton and his sniveling sidekick Captain Hadley; and be moved by the eloquent ending of this fantastic and unforgettable film.  It truly is an experience not to be missed.

I think with the exception of a few outdoor scenes in the movie where you see a little sky, the bulk of the movie is shot in the drab gray tones of prison (cause prison is drab and gray), so when that BIG BLUE OCEAN hit's your eyes, it makes the whole experience of their freedom and the fact that they never gave up hope that much more dramatic.Hope is definitely a good thing and quite possibly, the best of ALL things.",10,Why the ending is so moving

But just like everyone else in jail, Andy is ""innocent."" Andy's main argument for the situation was that he was drunk and did not remember. He said that he thought of trying to scare them and later on, threw the gun into the lake. When Andy arrives to the prison, everyone is walked down the entrance way into Shawshank prison while the character Red (Morgan Freeman), the ""go-to guy"", makes a bet that Andy will be the first person to ""crack"" or ""go insane"" and burst into tears. Red and his friends of convicts all bet cigarettes on different inmates to see which will be the first one to crack. Shockingly, Red loses the bet as Andy remains emotionless and lifeless as he walks through the walls of Shawshank. But as Red continues to observe Andy's behavior, he soon realizes that Andy is more unique than he seems. As Red's observation continues, he notices that Andy starts treating prison like life outside of the walls. Andy approaches Red and asks him for a ""Rock Hammer"" which is basically like a shrunken mining pick. Andy continues to sculpt rocks and make chess pieces for his own amusement.When the cells close and the lights go off, if an inmate becomes rowdy, the guards give them an ""Accident"" eventually leading to the inmates death. Andy almost experiences an ""Accident"" when he stops working and interrupts a guard's conversation. Andy helps him with his situation in exchange for the workers have a day off and drink beer, and thus, he becomes in favor of the guards and the inmates. Andy soon finds himself in favor of the Warden as he starts doing everyone's taxes. When Andy is abused and beaten by the gang/group of inmates called, ""The Sisters,"" the guards stand in Andy's favor where they get the lead sister have an ""accident."" Andy does what he can to help the prison become a more comfortable environment where he builds a fancy library and retrieves a larger budget for ""new"" used books. Andy does what he can in the favor of the inmates and earns a high respect. In this dramatic/suspenseful movie, hope is the main theme of the movie. Red tells Andy, ""Hope can kill a man."" Andy replies, ""No, Hope give a man a reason to live, hope can set you free.""

The cinematography breaks the barriers of present day prejudice, without ever directly referencing them. The concepts presented show us what is within our control, and what is decided for us. The dialogue bears witness to the realities we prefer to ignore, without actually giving us unwanted imagery.Most important of all, the film's climax provides us with a shining example of what we all crave: no matter the challenges we face, hope is the only thing that cannot be taken from us.

But also with obvious problems in providing something new. The same situations and characters are presented just from here to eternity, and I rest my case with this movie in question as follows: despotic warden, sadistic guard/s, evil fellow inmates who want to kill/rape you but also few trusted friends (along with that one old timer and his inevitable sad ending) and finally escape by the main protagonist who of course has been convicted in the first place based on false accusations or at least something not-so-bad crime.So what's so special here? 9.1/10, come on... Maybe the same tricks worked here as in that other Stephen King's hit-penitentiary-drama ""The Green Mile"", i.e. manipulative scenes and quickly identified cardboard characters.

There is so much attention to detail in this film, such as Andy's and Brooks' scene in the old library where he times talking to Jake perfectly. This level of detail is unfortunately not seen today and films that are careless and without proper directorship are all too common nowadays unfortunately.

The editors use of voice-overs and flash backs sets the scenes for viewers allowing them to be able to see the events of the prison.My thematic ideas of the film are Isolation and imprisonment, which seems to be a large focus of the film. The bars, strict schedules, horrible guards are just some of the reason for isolation. The film shows a lot of people taking advantage of the system for their own gain, from Red, who smuggles anything into the prison.

The Godfather, The Return of the King, The Seven Samurai; all incredible movies, but the one flaw residing over all three is this: In very little ways are the protagonists in these true-to-life. A Mafia Don, a would-be King, warriors of old - they are larger than life; they have a quality to them that raises them above all others - and the films, thus, retain a quality in the realm of the fantastic that sully the realism they wish to portray.The Shawshank Redemption is not in the like. Not one of the characters could be called ""larger than life;"" in no way are any of the characters ""good"" or ""evil"" - the boundary is so grayed that it no longer exists; they're simply human, with sins, hopes, loves, and fears.

Based on a Stephen Kink's novel and directed by Frank Darabont, has an excellent cast headed by Tim Robbins, who plays the banker, and Morgan Freeman, who gives life to an inmate, particularly skilled in the art of smuggling goods inside the prison.Darabont deserves congratulations for the way he directed the film and wrote the screenplay. Thanks to him, this film is human and sentimental without exaggeration. Tim Robbins shone in its interpretation of banker Andrew Dufresne, a man shaken by the sudden collapse of his way of life, but that doesn't cease to dream with freedom and to help those who share his misfortune, even in the worst moments. Thanks to Robbins, Andrew Dufresne isn't a mere banker betrayed by fate, but a deeply generous and human person. Far from spending time lamenting his injustice or his downfall, this Dufresne is more concerned to adapt to his new situation and provide to his cell mates the means to ""trick the bad luck"" and maintain their hope, that same hope that he, himself, always tries to maintain. Another actor that deserves particular attention is Morgan Freeman, who incorporates ""Red"" Redding, a longtime inmate, admittedly guilty, that recounts the events in the first person. Bob Gunton gives body to the prison director who, with the Bible in his hand, will not hesitate to do all the things the Bible disapproves.

23 January 2014,tt0111161,ur34783415,False,"Shawshank is an example of the beauty and power that great cinema can conj our. A deceptive film of prison life that contains violence, humor, an extremely tear-jerking moment. A lot happens, yet the film just seems to amble confidently along like the film's main character. This film works on so many levels and definitely rewards repeated viewing. The cinematography and music are wonderful, as are the central performances. Yet for all this it is the tale itself and how it is told that makes this (one of) the greatest stories ever told. People have theorized about what this film means ...is it an disguised story of Jesus?...a simple tale of friendship?...a tale of corruption?...a lecture on faith and 'holding on'?...or is the main character not who we think it to be for 3/4 of the film?

Nevertheless, the Shawshank Redemption is a good movie and solid entertainment, filled with a compelling story, good actors and an accurate script.

11 July 2013,tt0111161,ur44966804,False,"The Shawshank Redemption is without a question one of the most brilliant movies I tally e'er seen. Siamese to The Immature Knot in more respects (and finer than it in most all of them), these two movies change shown us that Stephen Contender is a original not only of horror but also of prose that shakes the soul and moves the spunk. The strategy is mediocre, but Monarch did major things with it in his novel that are only furthered by the substance, and the acting is so top-rate it's near scary.Tim Robbins plays Andy Dufrane, wrongly imprisoned for 20 period for the slaying of his mate. The story focuses on Andy's relationship with ""Red"" Redding (Morgan Citizen, in probably his champion enactment) and his attempts to escape from Shawshank. Bob Gunton is positively ugly and frightening as Warder Norton, and there are extraordinary performances and cameos all around; the most salient one existence Gil Bellows (new as Goat of Commonwealth McBeal) as Tommy, a feller inmate of Andy's who suffers under the robust instrument of Norton.If you haven't seen this picture, GO AND Payoff IT NOW. You instrument not be frustrated. It is positively the top show of the '90's, and one of my Top 3 of all indication.

6 January 2007,tt0111161,ur11440584,False,"I would just like to begin by saying the Shawshank redemption is one of the worst movies I have ever seen despite it being number 2 in the IMDb top 250 list. As I went through the movie, it was so painful, boring and everything else which makes a boring movie, unbelievably slow movie. I am aware of the fact that most people had voted this movie as an ace movie but in my opinion it was the single worst movie i have ever encountered with. Although I admire the 1 actor in the movie I am sad to say that for me this movie is a waste of time. I regret ever watching it. However I would not be able to say ""do not watch this movie"" as the voting and the scores point otherwise. In my opinion the Shawshank Redemption should not even be on the 1-10000 list of the movies. It was just someone going into prison and making a difference. I am all for inspirational movies, just not this one. I would rather sit and stare into a blank spot rather than wasting my time watching this movie. No offense to the actors as they were not bad but the script, the story, the screenplay, the time period, nothing suited each other. I am just expressing how i feel about this movie and my final words to describe this movie: ""DO NOT WATCH"".",10,"Poor, Boring, Painful, Long, Slow....and all the other words which defines a bad movie"

On the left is 'The Dark Knight' and on the right is 'The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'. These are the best films of their outstanding trilogies and, in my opinion, are the greatest films of my generation. I have watched each countless times because they're filled with action, suspense and tension and also incorporate a sense of overcoming that which seems impossible to overcome.Then, purely because it was rated highly, I watch a film not of my generation, on a free DVD from the Sunday Times. Without special effects or a large budget, The Shawshank Redemption became my third poster because it exceeds the qualities TDK and ROTK have in abundance. Each are excellent. Shawshank's better.",10,Great among greats.
27 July 2000,tt0111161,ur0625436,False,"Arguably Tim Robbins' greatest performance to date.  Coming from someone who tends to appreciate movies set behind bars, this movie is every bit worth 10 stars!  I was astonished to find out that this is adapted from a great Stephen King short story, Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption.Before writing this review, I sat down, with a bowl of popcorn and a cold one (Pepsi), and watched this great movie again.  It has come to my opinion that there is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie, or the way it was put together. Everyone prisoner should be allowed to watch this movie, and hope that their warden would allow them to keep after the books, and then use that position to break out.  But, after all, this is Hollywood!",10,By far the easiest movie to watch over and over again!
5 February 2010,tt0111161,ur19475140,False,"Shawshank Redemption is a fantastic film from the beginning right till the end. It is really beautiful. The direction and script are really superb. The acting of Morgan Freeman is exceptional. If Forrest Gump was made on another year, he would certainly have got an Oscar. If you want me to describe the movie in one word,I would say, "" Beautiful."" The story was very good, the storytelling was better. The scriptwriter deserves an applause. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It certainly deserves a spot in the top 250. But having said that, I don't think this movie should be #1. It will be like a disgrace to the movies like Schindler's list and Forrest Gump because those movies really touched my heart. I think Schindler's List and Forrest Gump should come above Shawshank Redemption.1 thing I forgot to tell you. I liked the dialogue of Morgan Freeman with the parole evaluator. It was absolutely heart touching. This movie has a hidden propaganda. Well, not particularly hidden, anyway. It is about the question of imprisoning people. Should it be done??Do we have the right to do that?? Wouldn't it be better if we try to talk some sense into them?? Or, wouldn't it even be better if we kill them rather than to give them life sentences?? I think I have an answer but that shouldn't be discussed because I think this question will continue to be a moral dilemma of the human communityI really liked that dialogue. Rehabilitated?? Let me tell you something sonny, that word is for politicians so that you can wear a suit and a tie and can have a job. Brilliant. Heart touching.This movie is an emotional dilemma folded together into an easily understandable story. There is one more thing I need to put here. Most o f the people who have rated this movie # 1 haven't got a clue about this hidden message. They have rated this because of the surprise ending. This is an open criticism.",9,A Fantastic film.

29 December 2002,tt0111161,ur2120324,False,"Shawshank Redemption is a compelling, moving, and beautiful story which is darkly funny at times. This movie's #2 spot on IMDB is debatable, since it is essentially a formulaic Hollywood story with Hollywood characters... i.e. evil institution (guards) and noble rebels (""some"" prisoners) within a microcosm (prison). Andy Dufresne is so incredibly friggin' smart (for a banker) that is almost super-hero like. Though this is definitely a worthy film, in terms of sheer greatness, Shawshank missed Cool Hand Luke by *this much*... If you want a really top-of-the-line awesome prison movie, Cool Hand Luke is the one to see.",9,beautiful
28 March 2012,tt0111161,ur30627526,False,"What is there to say about this movie, except it is a triumph in film making. First of all anything narrated by Morgan Freeman you know is going to be a great movie. A story of a life behind bars with no end, this ordinary man turns Shawshank prison up side down. I think the fact that this movie is so simple is also the reason it is so great. There is no complicated cinematic techniques or special effects, just men talking to each other. Tim Robbins shows us that the good guys can win even when their livelihood has been taken away. Its the kind of movie that just makes you smile on the inside and lets you appreciate the simple things even if just for that day. The Shawshank Redemption is definitely a movie everyone should see, only if just to brighten your day.

I found myself at times cringing at certain scenes that are very hard to watch.Through this film I felt Andy's pain, his sadness, his fear and his rage; his yearning to be a free man once again and then his happiness as he breaks away from the clutches of that evil place.The acting is top-notch, all the actors give great performances, especially Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman whose narration gives the audience something to hold onto. I found it quite sad, when Red is released; a man who has spent his whole life behind bars and is unable to find any kind of belonging...until he finally decides to go after his old friend.But for me, it is when Andy chisels away night after night and crawls his way to freedom that brought tears to my eyes....As he screams out, while the rain falls on him.

17 May 2014,tt0111161,ur42662675,False,"A must watch from start to finish this movie has you glued to your seat and you actually care and hate some character's. if you like jail movies it is a great one and the acting is top notch . There are not many movies out there that can come close to the quality and excellence of this one from the story to the backgrounds and all the little details . Do your self a service and go and watch it I am sure you wont regret the 3hr length (give or take). g how they were handling their publishing duties. Selected media members were allowed to play the title, the amount of players at once was cut in half near release, and review copies were shipped out just in time for the release of the physical copies of the game. All of this is just speculation on the quality of the title, but after playing Borderlands 2, it makes sense. Even with the Ce-shaded art style being very flattering for weaker hardware, the game still had serious issues that could not be patched up in time for release. The frame rate is almost always below 30fps, and rarely ever stabilizes unless you were to go to a vacant area and just stand there. Sometimes, the game cannot process everything happening on the screen, and the entire game freezes for around 1-2 seconds. The hardware cannot keep up with the action at many points, and this leaves the player frozen, confused, and even sometimes dead. There are numerous cheap deaths in Borderlands 2 due to the lack of hardware power. Although it is clear that the game has many issues resulting from the port job, it is also clear that the developer legitimately tried at this daunting task. Sometimes when it comes to ports, the actual problems stem from the studio that is given the job",10,great movie
